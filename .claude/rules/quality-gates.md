# Quality Gates

## Gate 0: Skill Utilization

- [ ] Checked `.claude/skills/` for a matching skill?
- [ ] If skill exists, read the SKILL.md before responding?
- [ ] Applying framework, not generic LLM patterns?

Red flags: offering multiple tone variations, generic advice without framework, not asking clarifying questions specified in skill protocol.

## Gate 1: Purpose

- [ ] Clear answer to "Why does this matter?"
- [ ] Audience and their needs identified
- [ ] Success criteria defined

## Gate 2: Content

- [ ] Customer value articulated
- [ ] Trade-offs explicitly stated
- [ ] Assumptions identified
- [ ] Risks and mitigations included

## Gate 3: Quality

- [ ] Systematic framework applied

- [ ] Actionable recommendations
- [ ] Stakeholder decision-making enabled

## Gate 4: Executive Readiness

- [ ] Would this pass executive scrutiny?
- [ ] Can stakeholders take clear action?
- [ ] Success metrics quantified?

## Extended Gates

If `input/best-practices/quality-standards.md` exists, apply those IN ADDITION to these core gates.
