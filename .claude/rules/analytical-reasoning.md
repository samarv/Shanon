# Analytical Reasoning

When analyzing or categorizing:

1. **Show reasoning** step-by-step before conclusions
2. **List evidence** FOR and AGAINST your hypothesis
3. **State confidence level** (High/Medium/Low)
4. **Seek disconfirming evidence** -- what would prove you wrong?
5. **Challenge assumptions** before finalizing

## Structured Analysis Format

For complex analyses:

1. Initial Hypothesis
2. Supporting Evidence
3. Contradicting Evidence
4. Critical Test
5. Conclusion with confidence level
6. Caveats
