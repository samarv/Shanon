# High-Momentum Company Evaluation Framework

Your career growth is often a direct byproduct of your company's momentum. In hypergrowth environments, you gain years of experience in months because the system requires you to "ride the lightning." Use this 10-point checklist to identify companies with the underlying health metrics to support accelerated career progression.

## The 10-Point Hypergrowth Checklist

Evaluate any potential company against these specific metrics and qualitative markers:

### 1. The Rule of 40
The sum of the company's growth rate and profit margin should be 40% or higher. This indicates a healthy balance between expansion and financial sustainability.

### 2. Tier 1 Investors
Look for top-tier venture capital firms. They perform rigorous due diligence that you cannot do from the outside.
- **Check:** Are the investors in the *most recent* round still top-tier? High-quality early investors followed by mid-tier later rounds can signal a slowdown.

### 3. Net Dollar Retention (NDR)
NDR measures how much your revenue grows from existing customers.
- **Benchmark:** 100% means customers are staying. 140% is excellent. 180% (Snowflake's peak) is world-class hypergrowth.
- **Action:** Ask, "If we didn't add a single new customer this year, how much would our revenue grow?"

### 4. Net Promoter Score (NPS) or CSAT
Determine if customers "rapidly love" the product or if it's just "meh." Organic, viral word-of-mouth is the only way to sustain hypergrowth; you cannot pay your way to those rates indefinitely.

### 5. Market Leadership
Identify if the company is #1 in its market. Look for Gartner Magic Quadrant positioning or Forrester Wave reports. Being #1 creates a "gravity" that makes everything (hiring, selling, PR) easier.

### 6. Burn Rate and Runway
In an "economic efficiency" market, ensure the company isn't about to run out of cash. Ask about their path to profitability or their months of runway remaining.

### 7. Glassdoor and Internal Sentiment
Analyze Glassdoor reviews for cultural red flags. Companies with toxic cultures or unhappy employees rarely survive long enough to achieve massive scale.

### 8. Revenue Connectivity
Evaluate how clearly the product's value proposition ties to the customer's revenue. Products that are "nice to have" are the first to be cut in a downturn; "must-haves" drive NDR.

### 9. Hiring Quality
Look for "2X and 3X leaders"—executives who have already seen the stage of growth the company is about to hit (e.g., hiring a leader who has taken a company from $50M to $200M when you are at $20M).

### 10. Product Virality/Inbound Signals
Identify if the product has natural collaboration loops (like Miro or Figma) or high SEO/SEM intent. High-momentum companies usually have a strong inbound engine rather than relying solely on expensive outbound prospecting.

## How to Gather Data During the Interview

If you aren't an executive with access to the data room, use these "Yoda-style" questions to uncover the truth:

1. **On NDR:** "When customers renew, are they typically expanding their seat count or adding new modules, and by what percentage?"
2. **On Efficiency:** "How has our CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) shifted over the last three quarters as we've tried to scale?"
3. **On Strategy:** "Is our growth coming primarily from net new logos (expensive) or from our existing base (efficient)?"
4. **On Product-Market Fit:** "What was the most common reason we lost a deal to a competitor in the last 90 days?"

## Examples

**Example 1: The "Best of Breed" Startup**
*   **Scenario:** You have an offer from a Series C dev-tool startup.
*   **Application:** You find they have 150% NDR and a #1 ranking on G2, but their last round was led by a firm you don't recognize.
*   **Decision:** Investigate why Tier 1 firms passed on the latest round despite the high NDR. It may indicate a "bag of doorknobs" product suite that isn't marketable as a platform.

**Example 2: The Up-Market Pivot**
*   **Scenario:** A company is moving from SMB to Enterprise.
*   **Application:** Use the checklist to see if they've hired an Enterprise-experienced Sales VP and if the product has "must-have" revenue connectivity for large firms.
*   **Decision:** If they are moving up-market but haven't changed their product roadmap or support structure, the momentum will likely stall.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Chasing the "Sexy" Brand Over Metrics:** Many famous brands have terrible unit economics. Don't join a "cool" company if their Rule of 40 is negative and their burn rate is unsustainable.
*   **Ignoring Glassdoor "Trends":** One bad review is a fluke; a trend of reviews mentioning "lack of transparency" or "changing priorities" usually indicates a strategic vacuum at the top.
*   **Overestimating Bundling:** Don't assume a company will win just because they "bundle" features. Bundling often slows down the initial "land" in a Product-Led Growth motion. Best-of-breed products often beat mediocre bundles in high-growth phases.
*   **Settling for "Crappy" Logos:** Every logo on your resume prepares you for the next one. If a company fails the 10-point checklist, the logo won't help your career "transcend" to the next level.
