description: A framework for transitioning from founder-led sales to a repeatable sales team. Use this when you have closed your first 10 unaffiliated customers, are spending more than 20% of your time on sales, and need to "A-B test" your sales process with your first two hires.

# Building the Initial Sales Pod

Transitioning from founder-led sales to a professional sales team is a high-risk phase. Success depends on hiring "Pirates and Romantics"—people who love the craft of sales and your specific product—rather than "Process Junkies" from large tech companies.

## Phase 1: The Transition Trigger
Do not hire sales reps until you meet these three criteria:
1.  **Close 10 Unaffiliated Customers:** You must personally close 10 customers who found you "from the ether" (not friends or former colleagues).
2.  **The 20% Rule:** You are spending more than 20% of your weekly time on sales and your calendar is becoming a bottleneck.
3.  **Become an "A+ Middler":** You have mastered the middle of the sales conversation—explaining the product and solving problems—even if you aren't yet great at "opening" or "closing."

## Phase 2: The "Two-Rep" Rule
Always hire **two** sales reps at the same time. 
- **The Purpose:** You must A-B test humans. If you hire one rep and they fail, you won't know if the problem is the rep, the product, or the leads.
- **The Budget:** Plan for an Initial Ramp Period. For the first quarter, let them keep a higher percentage (even up to 100%) of what they close to "put supper on the stove" while they learn.

## Phase 3: The Selection Heuristics
When interviewing 30+ candidates to find your two, use these three filters:

### 1. The "Would I Buy From Them?" Test
Forget the resume logos. Ask yourself: "Knowing everything I know about my product's flaws and strengths, would I buy it from this person?" If the answer isn't a gut "Yes," do not hire them.

### 2. The Harder Product Heuristic
Only hire someone whose **last product was harder to sell** than yours.
- **Harder:** More technical, more competitive, number 4 in the market, or a more complex business process.
- **Easier:** A commodity, the clear market leader, or a simple transactional tool.
*Why: If they succeeded in a harder environment, selling your product will feel like "walking on Mars" (weightless/easy).*

### 3. The "Pirate and Romantic" Profile
Avoid the "Big Company Veteran" (from Snowflake, Salesforce, etc.) who relies on massive sales ops and enablement teams. Look for the "quirky" candidate with high IQ who has fallen in love with your feature-poor product.

## Phase 4: The Interview "Demo"
Never hire a rep who hasn't watched your explainer video or webinar.
1.  **Assign the Demo:** Give them time to prepare a demo of your actual product.
2.  **The "Sell Me This Pen" (App Edition):** Have them pitch the product back to you. 
3.  **The Goal:** You aren't looking for perfection; you are looking for their ability to understand the **core problem solved**, not just the features.

## Phase 5: Comp and Quota Setup
- **Market Rate OTE (On-Target Earnings):** Usually split 50/50 (Base Salary/Commission).
- **The 4x-5x Multiple:** Long-term, a rep should bring in 4x to 5x what they take home.
- **The Quick Start:** For the first 90 days, give them a "draw" or a high commission floor so they can earn while they ramp.

## Examples

**Example 1: The Harder Product Heuristic**
*   **Scenario:** You are selling a new Project Management tool for engineers.
*   **Candidate A:** Sold Salesforce (Market Leader).
*   **Candidate B:** Sold a complex, legacy Financial Compliance API that engineers hated to integrate.
*   **Decision:** Hire Candidate B. They learned to handle extreme technical objections. Your PM tool will feel like a "gift" to their prospects by comparison.

**Example 2: The "Middler" Founder Transfer**
*   **Context:** A founder who hates "smarmy" sales tactics needs to train the first two reps.
*   **Input:** The founder's "A+ Middle" script (how they solve the video-streaming lag for current clients).
*   **Application:** The reps take the "Middler" talk track and add the "Ask" at the end: "What is the next step to get you going by next Tuesday?"
*   **Output:** The reps move the ball down the field using the founder’s expertise but adding the sales discipline the founder lacked.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Hiring a VP of Sales too early:** Never hire a VP until you have two reps hitting their quota. A VP's job is to scale from 3 to 300, not to find the first repeatable sale.
- **Hiring for Logos:** Hiring someone because they worked at a hot company (like Twilio). These reps often don't know how to hunt; they only know how to catch inbound leads.
- **Hiring the "Burnt Out Veteran":** Avoid candidates who say they want to "focus on process" or "territory planning" in their first 30 days. You need people who want to be on 5+ customer calls a day.
- **Skipping Reference Checks:** In the rush to hire, founders skip back-channeling. Always check if they were actually in the top 10% of their previous team.
