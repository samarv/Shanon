# Teresa Torres on Opportunity Framing

Key insights from Teresa Torres' teaching on writing opportunities for the Opportunity Solution Tree.

## The Core Problem

> "98% of people that write opportunities write them as solutions."

This is the single most common failure point in using the OST framework. Teams conflate the problem space with the solution space, which kills divergent thinking and leads to building the wrong things.

## Quality Standards

> "I've seen blog posts written about how they're using the opportunity solution tree, and I cry a little bit because their opportunity space is all solutions. I don't want to knock down somebody's blog post, but I also don't want this bad example out there in the world."

The bar is high. Bad examples of OST cause more harm than good by teaching the anti-pattern.

## Why This is Hard

> "This is the opposite of how our brains are wired."

Our brains naturally jump to solutions. Staying in the problem space requires deliberate practice and discipline.

## The Skill Stack Required

> "I'm probably going to make you think harder than you've ever had to think in your job."

Opportunity framing is intellectually demanding work that requires:
- Critical thinking
- Pattern recognition across stories
- Ability to distinguish needs from solutions
- Discipline to stay in the problem space

## Interview Technique

Don't ask direct questions like "What do you like to watch on Netflix?"

Instead: "Tell me about the last time you watched something on a streaming service."

Then follow up with:
- "What happened next?"
- "Tell me more about that."

## Opportunities from Stories

Opportunities emerge from customer stories, not from direct questions.

The stories reveal unmet needs that customers might not articulate when asked directly.

## Specificity Matters

Bad: "I wish this was easier to use"
- Too broad, unsolvable, not actionable

Good: "It's hard to enter my password - selecting specific letters on the screen with the Apple TV remote"
- Specific, concrete, actionable

## Going Deeper Vertically

Start big, then decompose:

Big: "I can't decide what to watch"
Smaller: "I don't know if this show is good"
Actionable: "I can't see who's in the cast"

This enables continuous, smaller bets rather than massive projects.

## The Framework Purpose

> "Help teams shift from being told 'build these features' to figuring out 'what should we build to achieve this outcome?'"

The OST adds structure to an otherwise messy, wide-open problem space.

## Experience Mapping

Structure opportunities using an experience map of the customer journey.

Netflix example phases:
1. Trigger (deciding to watch something)
2. Choosing what to watch
3. Evaluating if it's good
4. The viewing experience
5. Post-viewing experience

Each phase contains specific needs and pain points.

## Discovery is Continuous

> "Treating discovery as a phase before delivery"

This is an anti-pattern. Discovery and delivery should happen in parallel, continuously.

## Compare Multiple Solutions

> "Working with only one solution"

Another anti-pattern. Compare and contrast multiple solutions to avoid over-committing to a weak idea.

## The Gold is in Follow-ups

> "Missing the gold by not asking follow-up questions like 'What happened next?'"

Surface-level questions lead to surface-level insights. The real opportunities emerge when you dig deeper into the story.
