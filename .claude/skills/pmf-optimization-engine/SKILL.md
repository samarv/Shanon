description: A systematic, survey-based framework to measure and increase Product-Market Fit (PMF). Use this when a product launch feels stagnant, when determining which user feedback to prioritize, or when planning a roadmap to reach the "40% Very Disappointed" benchmark.

# PMF Optimization Engine

The PMF Optimization Engine is a quantitative method to measure how close a product is to market resonance and a qualitative framework to decide exactly what to build next. Rather than reacting to all user feedback, this engine filters for the "High Expectation Customers" who are most likely to become advocates.

## The Measurement Framework

### 1. The Core Survey Question
Ask your users: **"How would you feel if you could no longer use [Product]?"**
*   **Very disappointed**
*   **Somewhat disappointed**
*   **Not disappointed**

### 2. The 40% Benchmark
Track the percentage of users who answer "Very disappointed." 
*   **< 40%:** The product lacks sufficient PMF; scaling will likely fail.
*   **> 40%:** The product has found PMF; it is ready for aggressive growth.

## The Optimization Process

### Step 1: Segment the Respondents
Ignore the "Not disappointed" group entirely—they are a "lost cause" and will lead the roadmap astray. Focus on the "Very disappointed" (your core fans) and the "Somewhat disappointed" (your growth opportunity).

### Step 2: Identify the "Main Benefit"
Analyze the "Very disappointed" group. Ask them: **"What is the main benefit you receive from [Product]?"**
Categorize these into themes (e.g., speed, design, ease of use). This defines your product's "Superpower."

### Step 3: Filter the "Somewhat Disappointed" Group
Look at the "Somewhat disappointed" users and ask them: **"What is the main benefit you receive from [Product]?"**
*   **Keep:** Users whose main benefit matches the "Superpower" of your core fans. Something small is holding them back.
*   **Discard:** Users who value something else. Even if you build what they want, they will likely never become "Very disappointed" advocates.

### Step 4: Identify Barriers to Love
Ask the "Keep" segment of the "Somewhat disappointed" group: **"How can we improve [Product] for you?"**
Identify the specific missing features or "objections" that prevent them from moving into the "Very disappointed" category.

### Step 5: Build the 50/50 Roadmap
Allocate your R&D resources according to two equal priorities:
1.  **50% - Doubling Down:** Enhance the features that the "Very disappointed" users already love (e.g., if they love speed, make it even faster).
2.  **50% - Overcoming Objections:** Build the specific features requested by the "Keep" segment of the "Somewhat disappointed" users (e.g., adding a mobile app or specific integration).

## Examples

**Example 1: A Productivity Tool**
*   **Baseline:** 32% "Very disappointed."
*   **Core Fans Love:** "Keyboard shortcuts for navigation."
*   **Target Segment:** "Somewhat disappointed" users who also value "Navigation speed" but find the tool "Lacking a mobile app."
*   **Roadmap:** 50% of the sprint spent optimizing shortcut latency; 50% spent building the iOS MVP.

**Example 2: A B2B Analytics Dashboard**
*   **Baseline:** 25% "Very disappointed."
*   **Core Fans Love:** "Automated reporting."
*   **Target Segment:** Users who value "Automation" but said "The data doesn't integrate with Slack."
*   **Roadmap:** 50% spent improving report customization; 50% spent building a Slack integration.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Listening to "Not Disappointed" Users:** These users often request features that dilute the core value proposition. Building for them will likely lower the PMF score.
*   **Neglecting Core Fans:** Only focusing on "Somewhat disappointed" users leads to "feature creep" where the product loses the unique quality that made the initial users love it.
*   **Changing Survey Methodology:** Switching from email surveys to in-app popups mid-stream will invalidate your baseline data. Pick one method and stay consistent to track progress over time.
*   **Premature Scaling:** Spending on marketing before hitting the 40% mark. Without PMF, your "leaky bucket" will waste capital.
