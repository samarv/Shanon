# SEO Traffic Light Framework

The Traffic Light Framework is an operational machinery for SEO that ensures every piece of content produced directly contributes to revenue. It moves away from "keyword stuffing" and focus on a single quality metric: **Is the Google search over?** If a user reads your content and returns to Google to keep searching, you have failed. If they stay or convert, you have succeeded.

## Phase 1: The Traffic Light Prioritization
Do not write content based on volume alone. Use this system to categorize up to 700+ keywords before starting production.

1.  **Extract Keywords:** List every keyword related to your space, even distantly related ones.
2.  **Rank by Volume:** Sort the list from highest monthly search volume to lowest.
3.  **Assign Intent "Lights":**
    *   **Green Light:** High business intent. The searcher has an active problem and is looking for a solution like yours (e.g., "how to hire in Germany").
    *   **Yellow Light:** Medium intent. The searcher is 50/50; they might need a solution soon or are researching a peripheral topic (e.g., "remote work trends").
    *   **Red Light:** No business intent. The searcher is likely a student, a researcher, or looking for something unrelated (e.g., "history of payroll").
4.  **The Execution Order:**
    *   Priority 1: Green Lights, highest volume to lowest.
    *   Priority 2: Yellow Lights, highest volume to lowest.
    *   Priority 3: Never write for Red Lights, regardless of volume.

## Phase 2: User Intent Analysis
Before writing, verify what Google actually wants to show for that keyword.

*   **The "Oil Recovery" Test:** Check the top results for your keyword. If you want to rank for "EOR" (Employer of Record) but Google shows "Enhanced Oil Recovery," do not target that keyword. Google has decided the intent is different.
*   **Predict the "Next Question":** Look at the "People Also Ask" section. Your article must answer the primary keyword *and* the next 3–4 questions the user will have after reading.
*   **Keep it Simple:** Use tools like Clearscope to ensure the language is at a 4th or 5th-grade reading level. High sophistication in B2B content often leads to lower conversion and higher bounce rates.

## Phase 3: Content Operations
Manage the team like a factory, not a creative studio.

*   **Balance New vs. Updated:** As you scale, shift from 100% new content to a 50/50 split (e.g., 5 net new articles and 5 article updates per week).
*   **Fact-Checking Loop:** For regulated industries (HR, Legal, Finance), establish a recurring task to update articles every 6–12 months to ensure compliance information hasn't changed.
*   **Centralized Expertise:** Keep the SEO/Paid/Content teams sitting together functionally rather than siloed into regions. This allows technical learnings to transfer across the organization instantly.

## Examples

### Example 1: Global Payroll
*   **Keyword:** "How to pay contractors in Turkey"
*   **Status:** Green Light (High Intent).
*   **Application:** Write a definitive guide explaining the specific tax laws and banking requirements.
*   **The "Next Question":** "What are the penalties for misclassification in Turkey?" Add this as a sub-header.
*   **Result:** The search is over; the user understands the risk and sees your product as the compliance solution.

### Example 2: General Business Definitions
*   **Keyword:** "What is a 1099 form?"
*   **Status:** Yellow Light (Medium Intent).
*   **Application:** Produce this only after all "Green" Turkey/International hiring guides are finished.
*   **Analysis:** If the top Google results are all from the IRS, focus the content on *how to automate* the form rather than just defining it, to differentiate the value.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Targeting "Ego Keywords":** Writing for high-volume keywords that have zero business intent (Red Lights) just to see the traffic graph go up.
*   **Cutting Research Corners:** Skipping the manual intent check. If you write for a keyword where Google prefers a different definition, you will never rank.
*   **High-Level Language:** Writing "university level" content. This exhausts the reader. If they get bored and bounce, Google perceives the search as "not over" and drops your ranking.
*   **Ignoring Creative Fatigue:** In SEO, this manifests as "Content Decay." If you don't update articles that were written 2 years ago, they will eventually drop off the first page as competitors provide "fresher" answers.
