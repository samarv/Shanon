description: Evaluate product-market fit using the Sean Ellis Test. Use this skill when you have a live MVP and need a leading indicator of fit before investing in growth, when retention is low and you need to diagnose the cause, or when you need to identify your "must-have" user segment to refine positioning.

The Sean Ellis Test (or "The 40% Test") provides a leading indicator of product-market fit. While retention cohorts are the ultimate "lagging" proof of fit, this survey allows you to identify if you have a "must-have" product day one, without waiting months for data to mature.

## 1. Segment the Audience
Do not survey everyone. Surveying people who have only seen a demo or just signed up will result in "noise."
*   **Target:** Users who have experienced the "core" of the product.
*   **Criteria:** Must have used the product at least twice.
*   **Recency:** Must have used the product within the last 1–2 weeks (active users, not churned users).
*   **Sample Size:** Aim for at least 30–50 responses for valid initial signal.

## 2. Deploy the Primary Question
Ask the single most important question to gauge "must-have" status:

**"How would you feel if you could no longer use [Product Name]?"**
1.  **Very disappointed** (The "Must-Have" group)
2.  **Somewhat disappointed** (The "Nice-to-Have" group)
3.  **Not disappointed**
4.  **N/A – I no longer use the product**

## 3. Analyze the Threshold
*   **40% or higher "Very Disappointed":** You have found a "must-have" vein. You are ready to focus on activation and sustainable growth.
*   **Below 40%:** You are likely in a "commodity" state or targeting the wrong segment. Do not scale marketing yet; you will waste capital.

## 4. Extract the "Must-Have" Benefit
For the users who said they would be **Very Disappointed**, run a follow-up qualitative analysis to understand why they care.

### Step A: Open-Ended Discovery
Ask: "What is the primary benefit that you get from [Product]?" and "Why is that benefit important to you?"
*   Look for recurring language or "hooks" (e.g., "I'm drowning in email").

### Step B: Benefit Validation (Multiple Choice)
Once you have 4–5 recurring themes, survey a *different* group of users.
*   **Question:** "Which of these is the primary benefit you receive?" (Force a choice between the 4–5 themes).
*   **Question:** "What would you use if this product were no longer available?" (Identifies the true competition).

## 5. Move the Score (The "Lookout" Strategy)
If your score is low (e.g., 10-15%), use this workflow to reach the 40% threshold:
1.  **Isolate the "Very Disappointed" group:** Even if it's only 7%, find out who they are and what feature they use.
2.  **Reposition the Hook:** Update marketing and landing pages to focus *exclusively* on the specific benefit that 7% loved.
3.  **Streamline Onboarding:** Remove any steps that don't lead directly to that specific benefit. Ensure "Speed to Value" (Aha Moment) happens in the first session.
4.  **Ignore the "Somewhat Disappointed" users:** Do not build features for them yet. Trying to please everyone dilutes the product for your "must-have" core.

**Example 1: Mobile Security (Lookout)**
*   **Context:** A mobile app with backup, phone-finding, and antivirus features had only a 7% PMF score.
*   **Insight:** The 7% who loved it cared exclusively about "Antivirus," even though phone viruses were rare at the time.
*   **Application:** The team repositioned all marketing on "Antivirus" and changed onboarding so the first thing a user saw was an "Antivirus Scanning" progress bar.
*   **Output:** The score jumped to 40% in two weeks because the product now attracted people seeking that specific value and delivered it immediately.

**Example 2: Productivity Tool (Xobni)**
*   **Context:** Testing the primary benefit of an email plugin.
*   **Input:** Users were asked "Why is finding things faster important to you?"
*   **Application:** Qualitative responses repeatedly used the phrase "I'm drowning in email."
*   **Output:** The marketing was changed to lead with the "Drowning in email?" hook, which significantly increased the conversion of users who eventually became "Very Disappointed" must-have users.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Surveying Demos:** Asking "would you use this?" is useless. Only survey users who have actually performed the core action.
*   **The "Somewhat Disappointed" Trap:** Trying to convert "Somewhat Disappointed" users by adding their requested features. This often results in a mediocre product that is "good for everyone but great for no one."
*   **Ignoring Context:** Not asking *why* a benefit is important. The "why" provides the emotional context needed for high-performing acquisition copy.
*   **Premature Scaling:** Stepping on the gas (paid ads) when the score is at 15%. This results in high churn and "leaky bucket" syndrome.
