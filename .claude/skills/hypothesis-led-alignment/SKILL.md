description: Resolve organizational friction and "disagree and commit" scenarios by decomposing high-level mandates into testable assumptions. Use this when you disagree with a leadership directive, when a team is stuck in "vibe-based" decision-making, or when trying to find a "win-win" path for a controversial feature.

# Hypothesis-Led Alignment

Move from adversarial "yes/no" debates to collaborative experimentation by breaking down directives into the underlying assumptions that must be true for a project to succeed. This framework allows you to maintain conviction and "sturdiness" while remaining flexible enough to test reality.

## The Core Principles

*   **Diagnose with Data, Treat with Design:** Use data to identify where the problem or opportunity lies, but use design/creativity to invent the solution.
*   **Dimensionality over Identity:** Treat feedback and project outcomes as specific "dimensions" of performance, not as a reflection of your worth or the team's worth.
*   **The Win-Win Mentality:** Assume that the stakeholder wants a great outcome as much as you do. If there is friction, it is usually a disagreement on a specific, hidden assumption.

## The Process

### 1. Identify the Triggering Conviction
When an executive or stakeholder gives a directive you disagree with (e.g., "We must build a lemonade stand on every block"), do not push back on the *conclusion*. Instead, identify the specific assumptions they are making.

### 2. Decompose into Testable Hypotheses
Break the "vibe-based" mandate into three distinct categories of assumptions:
*   **User Intent Hypotheses:** "Users in this specific context actually want this product/beverage."
*   **Market Hypotheses:** "This specific location/timing is the optimal way to reach them."
*   **Mechanism Hypotheses:** "This specific feature/implementation is the best way to satisfy that intent."

### 3. Isolate the "Lemonade" Disagreement
Locate exactly where your intuition differs from the stakeholder's.
*   *Bad Pushback:* "I think lemonade stands are a stupid idea."
*   *Hypothesis-Led Pushback:* "I believe we agree that users want a cold drink (User Intent), but I'm skeptical that lemonade is the specific beverage they want right now (Mechanism Hypothesis). I think they might prefer iced coffee."

### 4. Propose the "Smallest Testable Version"
Shift the conversation from "Should we do the whole project?" to "How do we validate the disputed assumption?"
*   Instead of a nationwide rollout, propose a test in one specific market to validate the core assumption (e.g., "Do 18-25-year-olds on college campuses actually buy lemonade?").

### 5. Check Your Internal Intent
Before delivering the proposal, ask yourself: "Am I doing this to be right/punish the other person, or am I doing this to help the team get the best outcome?" If the intent isn't a "win-win," the feedback will be received as adversarial.

## Examples

**Example 1: The CEO Mandate**
*   **Context:** The CEO wants to add a "Social Feed" to a utility app. The PM thinks it will clutter the UI and fail.
*   **Application:** The PM identifies the core assumption: "Users want to see what their friends are doing *within this specific app context*."
*   **Output:** Instead of arguing against the feed, the PM proposes: "We aren't sure if users want social interaction here. Let's run a 1-week 'Smoke Test' with a simple notification to 5% of users to see if they even click to see friend activity before we build the full feed."

**Example 2: The "Vibe-Based" Design Change**
*   **Context:** A designer wants to overhaul the checkout flow because it "feels dated," but the data shows it converts well.
*   **Application:** The Manager uses the "Diagnose with Data, Treat with Design" model.
*   **Output:** "The data shows no 'disease' in the current conversion rate (No diagnosis of a problem). However, we can treat the 'Design Debt' dimension. Let's hypothesize that a modern UI will increase *Trust*, which will increase LTV. Let's test the new UI on a small segment specifically to measure repeat purchase intent, not just immediate conversion."

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Treating it as a Delay Tactic:** Using "testing" to avoid doing something you simply don't like. If the CEO says "Move fast," the test must be genuinely faster than the build.
*   **Parroting Orders:** Telling your team "The CEO told us to do this, so we have to." This destroys your conviction and the team's motivation. Always find the hypothesis you *can* get behind (e.g., "We are testing the hypothesis that X matters").
*   **Lack of Vulnerability:** Delivering pushback without acknowledging the relationship.
    *   *Correction:* Use the "Humanizing Lead-in": "I'm nervous to share this because I value our alignment, but I'm worried about Assumption X and want to make sure this project succeeds."
*   **Ignoring the "Willow Tree" Balance:** Being so "sturdy" (rigid) that you break under change, or so "flexible" that you have no North Star. Use the hypothesis to stay rooted in the goal while being flexible on the implementation.
