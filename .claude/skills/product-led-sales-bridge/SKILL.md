name: product-led-sales-bridge
description: A framework for converting self-serve product usage into high-value enterprise contracts. Use this when your self-serve revenue hits a ceiling, when you need to transition individual users to team-wide adoption, or when sales teams need higher-intent pipeline based on actual product behavior.

Product-led sales (PLS) acts as a bridge between individual product-led growth (PLG) and enterprise sales-led growth (SLG). It leverages product usage data to identify when an account is ready to move from a "prosumer" use case to an organization-wide solution.

## 1. Translate Individual Value to Enterprise Value
Products are often designed to solve individual "jobs-to-be-done," but enterprise buyers pay for "organizational outcomes." You must bridge this gap in your sales narrative.

- **Identify the Individual Use Case:** What does the person do alone? (e.g., A designer creating a mock-up in Figma).
- **Identify the Team Use Case:** How do they collaborate? (e.g., A team capturing feedback on designs).
- **Define the Enterprise Value Prop:** What is the organizational impact? (e.g., Faster time-to-market and better design-to-business alignment).

## 2. Define Product Qualified Accounts (PQAs)
Establish a PQA threshold to identify accounts ready for sales intervention. Use a mix of volume, velocity, and behavioral signals.

### Core PQA Metrics
- **The "Rule of Seven":** Look for accounts with 7 or more active users. This often indicates the "herd mentality" necessary for an enterprise deal.
- **Usage Volume:** Set thresholds based on your value metric (e.g., number of boards created, messages sent, or data events tracked).
- **Velocity Change:** Identify sudden spikes in usage (e.g., an account adding 15 users in a day after months of adding one per week).

### High-Intent Behavioral Signals
- **Admin Transitions:** Watch for changes in account ownership or new admins being assigned.
- **Legal/Security Interest:** Track visits to the "Terms of Service," "Privacy Policy," or "Security" pages from specific accounts.
- **Push vs. Pull:** Implement mechanisms where new sign-ups from an existing company domain are "pushed" into the existing corporate account rather than creating rogue silos.

## 3. Implement Strategic User Profiling
Don't rely on guesswork. Profile users during onboarding to distinguish between users and potential buyers.

**Ask these 4 mandatory questions (across 3-4 screens):**
1. **Company Size:** Helps segment by ICP (Ideal Customer Profile).
2. **Department:** Identifies the functional area of the user.
3. **Seniority:** Determines if they are an end-user or a decision-maker.
4. **Use Case:** Reveals the specific problem they are trying to solve.

*Note: Do not worry about a small drop-off in sign-up completion. High-intent users will answer these; low-intent users who drop off were unlikely to activate anyway.*

## 4. Align Cross-Functional Accountability
Shift the internal configuration of your teams to support a usage-based pipeline.

- **Product Responsibility:** Own the "Monetization Awareness" and the PQA pipeline. Product is accountable for getting accounts to the threshold where sales can intervene.
- **Marketing Responsibility:** Find the "Buyer" outside the user base. If usage is high (PQA) but no decision-maker is present, Marketing must use Account-Based Marketing (ABM) to attract the executive buyer.
- **Sales Responsibility:** Act as an "Enterprise Facilitator." Use usage data to tell a personalized story and navigate the internal committee to close $15k+ contracts.

## Examples

**Example 1: Visual Collaboration Tool**
- **Context:** A company has 20 individual free accounts with no connection to each other.
- **Application:** Product identifies the account as a PQA because the domain has >7 users. Sales detects that a user recently visited the "Enterprise Security" page.
- **Output:** Sales reaches out to the IT Director (found by Marketing) with a pitch: "You have 20 teams using this insecurely; let's consolidate them into one secure enterprise workspace with SSO."

**Example 2: Data Analytics Platform**
- **Context:** An individual developer installs an SDK to track their specific feature.
- **Application:** Usage velocity spikes as the developer begins sending 1M+ events per day.
- **Output:** Product triggers an "Account Executive Pilot." Instead of asking for a budget immediately, Sales offers a "Value Discovery" session to show how the whole product team can use this data to build a data-driven culture.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Premature Interruption:** Reaching out 10 minutes after sign-up. New users are solving individual problems; wait for PQA signals before sales intervention.
- **User vs. Buyer Confusion:** Assuming the person using the tool is the one who can sign a $50k check. You often need to find the buyer *outside* the product.
- **Ignoring Monetization Awareness:** Assuming users know what is in the paid plan. Ensure feature walls and "gold-standard" UI triggers are visible to free users.
- **Impatience with the Cycle:** Expecting PLS deals to close in 30 days. On average, it takes 12+ months of usage to escalate an individual problem to an enterprise contract.
- **Siloed Ownership:** Putting PLS entirely in Marketing/Sales. If Product doesn't own the pipeline (PQAs), the motion will fail within six months.
