description: A strategic framework for spreading product news or company updates by targeting audiences in sequential stages—from internal teams to power users and then broader circles. Use this when launching a new feature, announcing a company pivot, or building a brand from scratch.

The most effective ideas do not spread through broad-market saturation. They spread by applying high pressure to small, specific "cultural erogenous zones"—the things people already care about—and scaling outward through trusted advocates.

## Core Framework: The Concentric Circles

Do not release news to everyone at once. Sequence your communication to ensure each inner circle validates the message for the next one. If an inner circle is not excited, the outer circle will not believe the message.

1.  **Circle 1: Internal (Employees and Co-founders):** The "source of truth." They must be the most vocal advocates.
2.  **Circle 2: The Power Users (Diehards):** Your earliest or most active users. They need to feel like "insiders" who have early access or influence.
3.  **Circle 3: Niche Influencers and Centers of Gravity:** The individuals your target audience follows for advice (e.g., industry-specific podcasters, newsletter writers).
4.  **Circle 4: General Public and Mainstream Media:** The final stage, reached only after the narrative has been validated by the inner circles.

## Messaging Strategy: Finding the "Erogenous Zone"

Stop trying to change someone’s worldview to fit your product. Instead, shape your product message to fit their existing worldview.

*   **Create the API:** If your audience cares about X (e.g., security) and you are offering Y (e.g., an education tool), build the bridge. Explain how Y is the only way to achieve X.
*   **The "Pill in the Cheese" Rule:** Wrap your core message (the pill) in something people actually want to consume (the cheese), such as a joke, a mental image, or a colorful analogy.
*   **Avoid Adjectives:** Do not say your product is "innovative" or "fast." Tell a specific anecdote or story that proves it. Adjectives are subjective and forgettable; stories are repeatable.

## The Physics of Impact

To maximize the pressure of your message, use the formula: **Pressure = Force / Area**

*   **Force:** The amount of effort, time, and money you spend.
*   **Area:** The size of the audience you are targeting.
*   **Action:** Decrease your surface area. Instead of spending a $1M budget to reach 1 million people with a weak message, spend the same effort reaching 100 "diehards" who will become your primary messengers.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Define the Business Goal:** Identify the specific action you want people to take (e.g., buy a subscription, download an app).
2.  **Map the Beliefs:** Determine what the audience must believe in order to take that action.
3.  **Identify the Medium:** Find where your target audience "resides intellectually" (e.g., Substack, LinkedIn, specific subreddits).
4.  **Draft the "Direct" Message:** Write the announcement as a human, not a corporation. Use "I" or "we," admit vulnerabilities, and avoid corporate "decrees."
5.  **Pitch the Circles:** Start with Circle 1. Once they are aligned, move to Circle 2, and so on.

## Examples

**Example 1: The "API" Bridge**
*   **Context:** A politician needs to fund K-12 reading standards but the general public only cares about national security.
*   **Input:** "We need better reading programs for 10-year-olds."
*   **Application:** Connect the reading program to the military's requirement that recruits have a 10th-grade reading level to understand field manuals.
*   **Output:** "If you care about national defense, you must care about 4th-grade reading standards."

**Example 2: The Concentric Circle Launch**
*   **Context:** Substack launching a "Recommendations" feature.
*   **Circle 1:** Brief employees to ensure they can explain the value.
*   **Circle 2:** Give "Power Writers" early access and ask for feedback. They feel like insiders and begin talking about it organically.
*   **Circle 3:** When the feature goes live, the Power Writers are already evangelizing it to their followers.
*   **Circle 4:** The mainstream media reports on the feature because they see the "diehard" community is already obsessed with it.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Inside Jokes:** Avoid analogies that only make sense to you or your team (e.g., referring to a niche book review). If a second-grader can't grasp the mental image, it won't spread.
*   **Mistakes of Omission:** Choosing to say nothing to "minimize risk." In a startup, the status quo is your enemy. Silence allows the status quo to win.
*   **Corporate Cosplay:** Speaking like a faceless "C-Corp" because you think it makes you look professional. People trust people, not institutions.
*   **Channel Dilution:** Trying to be on TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram at once. Pick the one channel the founder is naturally best at (writing, video, or audio) and dominate that "tiny monopoly" first.
