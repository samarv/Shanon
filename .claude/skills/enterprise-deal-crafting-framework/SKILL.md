name: enterprise-deal-crafting-framework
description: A methodology for scaling from $1M to $10M ARR by targeting Tier-1 logos and shifting from problem-selling to vision-casting. Use this when moving upmarket from SMBs, when prospects compare you to lower-cost competitors, or when you need to justify $100k+ ACVs.

This framework is designed to bridge the gap between "founder-led sales" and a scalable enterprise engine. It treats enterprise sales as an art of deal-crafting and relationship-building rather than a rigid playbook of technical problem-solving.

## Core Principles

- **Avoid the Mid-Market Trap:** Treat the "mid-market" as non-existent. You are either playing the marketing-led SMB game or the sales-led Enterprise game. Bleeding the two leads to hiring and pricing failures.
- **Target Tier-1 Logos Early:** Contrary to popular belief, the world’s leaders (Walmarts, NVIDIAs, Teslas) are often the best early adopters. They have the most to lose and will take swings on startups to maintain their "Alpha" and avoid disruption.
- **Sell the Gap, Not the Problem:** "Problem selling" is technical and commoditized. "Gap selling" or "Vision casting" focuses on the opportunity—what the customer becomes tomorrow because of you today.

## The Deal-Crafting Workflow

### 1. Identify "Alpha" Opportunities
Instead of looking for companies with a specific technical pain point, look for leaders who need a competitive edge (Alpha).
- **The Research:** Look for companies in the news or industry reports that are fighting to stay #1.
- **The Angle:** Ask, "What information or capability can we give them that puts them ahead of their peers by even 1%?"

### 2. Perform the Vision Cast
Shift your messaging from what the product *is* to who the buyer *becomes*.
- **The Mushroom vs. Superhero:** Use the "Mario" analogy. Don't sell the mushroom (the product/feature); sell "Mario on Blast" (the empowered customer).
- **Language Shift:** Instead of "We solve [Problem X]," say "We provide the opportunity for you to [Unlock Value Y] that the rest of the market doesn't have yet."

### 3. Anchor at the "Enterprise Floor" ($75k–$150k)
Enterprises are used to buying in the $75k to $150k range. Pricing lower ($10k) can actually hurt your credibility and make it harder to expand later.
- **Avoid "Small Business" Anchoring:** If a Tier-1 logo wants to start small, ensure you frame it as a "limited access" pilot while clearly documenting that the full-value price is $100k+.
- **Defend the 10x:** It is nearly impossible to justify a price jump from $1k to $100k to procurement later. Start high to make the value defendable.

### 4. Co-Author the Deal Structuring
Enterprise deals are won through relationships and "cosplaying the founder." Every deal should look slightly different.
- **Ask the "Scary" Question:** "Is it actually possible to get this deal done this year, or am I misinterpreting the timing?"
- **Creative Packaging:** Include services or manual support to get your foot in the door. If they are used to buying consultants, sell a "forward-deployed" service powered by your software.
- **Text-Message Trust:** Build a relationship where you can text the executive. If they know you will "turn over rocks" to make them successful, they will turn over rocks to get the deal through procurement.

## Examples

**Example 1: Vision Casting for an AI Coding Tool**
- **Context:** Selling to a CTO at a Fortune 500 company.
- **Problem Sell:** "Our tool helps your engineers write code 20% faster." (Low value, easy to compare to others).
- **Vision Cast (The Alpha):** "10x engineers are only joining companies that use this specific stack. If you don't adopt this, you won't just be slower; you'll lose the talent war to your competitors. We help you attract the top 1% of engineering talent."
- **Result:** The CTO buys to protect the organization's future, not just to save developer hours.

**Example 2: The Manual Backdoor (Service-to-SaaS)**
- **Context:** A startup with "janky" early-stage software selling to a global retailer.
- **Input:** The retailer is hesitant about a new software implementation.
- **Application:** The founder offers a $120k "Strategic Assessment" where the startup's team does the work manually using their internal tools to deliver a high-value report/outcome.
- **Output:** The retailer sees the "Alpha" immediately. After 6 months, the founder moves them to a $250k SaaS contract to "automate the process we’ve been doing for you."

## Common Pitfalls

- **Standardized Playbooks:** Treating enterprise sales like a science. At this stage, it is an art. If every deal looks the same, you aren't being creative enough with your deal-crafting.
- **Getting Stuck in Procurement:** This is usually a qualification error. It means you haven't built a strong enough relationship with a senior executive who can "pick up the phone" and move the deal through.
- **Hiring "Big Brand" Sales VPs Too Early:** VPs from Salesforce or Google often rely on the brand to build trust. In the $1M–$10M stage, you need "Founder Cosplayers"—people who can sell a vision when the product is still "janky."
- **Selling to "Nice" People:** Avoid the "maybe." If a prospect is just being nice but doesn't have a timeline, qualify them out immediately. A "No" is the best answer next to a "Yes" because it saves your most valuable resource: time.
