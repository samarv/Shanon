description: A framework to identify and develop sustainable competitive advantages (Power) based on a company's lifecycle stage. Use this when drafting a product strategy, evaluating business model durability, or distinguishing between "operational excellence" and true competitive moats.

# Power Progression Strategy

Sustainable competitive advantage requires **Power**, defined as the combination of a **Benefit** (a cost or price advantage) and a **Barrier** (the inability of competitors to mimic that advantage). This framework helps you identify which types of Power are available to your product based on its current phase: Origination, Takeoff, or Stability.

## The "To Be or Not To Be" Test
To determine if a feature or strategy provides true Power, ask:
1. **Benefit:** Does this create a material improvement in my margins (lower cost) or allow me to charge a higher price?
2. **Barrier:** If a competitor tried to do exactly what I am doing, would they be prevented by economics, physics, or psychology from succeeding?

If you have a benefit but no barrier, you are on a "treadmill" of operational excellence—you must run as fast as possible just to stay in place, but you have no refuge from competition.

## The Power Progression Workflow

### 1. Origination Phase (Pre-Product Market Fit)
In this stage, your primary goal is substitution—convincing users to switch from an existing solution to yours.
*   **Primary Power: Counter-Positioning.**
    *   **Action:** Develop a new, superior business model that an incumbent cannot mimic because doing so would damage their existing business (e.g., Netflix's mail-order DVDs vs. Blockbuster’s retail stores).
    *   **Heuristic:** If an incumbent's CFO would say "We can't do that because it would cannibalize our revenue," you have Counter-Positioning.

### 2. Takeoff Phase (Rapid Growth)
Once you have traction, your focus shifts to building barriers as you scale.
*   **Power Types to Pursue:**
    *   **Network Economies:** The value of your product increases as more people use it. **Note:** This must be *material*. If the effect is only worth a "penny to the bottom line," it is a network effect but not a Network Economy.
    *   **Scale Economies:** Spreading high fixed costs over a larger volume of users (e.g., Netflix spreading $15B in content costs over 200M+ subscribers).
    *   **Switching Costs:** Making it difficult or expensive for customers to leave (e.g., high integration effort or data lock-in).

### 3. Stability Phase (Mature Market)
These powers take a long time to build and are rarely available to startups.
*   **Power Types:**
    *   **Branding:** An objective feeling of safety or status that allows for a price premium.
    *   **Process Power:** Complex, opaque organizational knowledge that results in lower costs (e.g., Toyota’s production system).
    *   **Cornered Resource:** Preferential access to a coveted asset (e.g., a patent or a unique talent pool).

## Examples of Power in Action

**Example 1: Netflix and Scale Economies**
*   **Context:** Netflix vs. Blockbuster during the transition to streaming.
*   **Input:** High fixed costs for original content.
*   **Application:** Netflix invests billions in content. Because they have the largest subscriber base, the "cost per subscriber" for that content is significantly lower than for a smaller competitor like Hulu or Paramount+.
*   **Output:** Netflix achieves higher margins than competitors even when charging similar prices, creating a "barrier" because competitors cannot match their cost efficiency without first matching their scale.

**Example 2: Uber vs. Lyft (The Materiality Trap)**
*   **Context:** Analyzing the ride-sharing market.
*   **Input:** Geographic network effects (more drivers = lower wait times).
*   **Application:** While both have "network effects," they lack "Network Economies" because the advantage is not material enough to prevent a war of attrition.
*   **Output:** Because the "curve flattens" (a 3-minute wait isn't significantly better than a 5-minute wait for most users), the two companies remain in a constant price war, proving that not all network effects lead to Power.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

*   **Confusing Operational Excellence with Power:** Moving fast, having a great team, or having a better UI are not "Power." These are "mimicable" traits. If a competitor can hire your VP of Engineering or copy your UI, you do not have a barrier.
*   **The Data Flywheel Myth:** Founders often claim data scale is a power. However, the value of additional data often experiences diminishing returns. If a competitor with 10% of your data can provide a "good enough" experience, your data is not a durable power.
*   **Ignoring Materiality:** Just because a "flywheel" exists doesn't mean it's a power. It must be strong enough to significantly tilt the economic returns of the business.
*   **Thinking Strategy is "Strategic Planning":** Strategy is not a to-do list for the year. It is a long-term focus on the fundamental determinants of business value (NPV of cash flow), specifically your source of Power.
