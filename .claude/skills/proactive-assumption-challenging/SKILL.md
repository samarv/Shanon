name: proactive-assumption-challenging
description: A framework for product leaders to validate their thinking by seeking out friction, empathizing with stakeholder constraints, and intentionally breaking mental models. Use this when a project feels "too smooth" without debate, when entering a high-stakes technical market, or when encountering misalignment with engineering or design.

Proactive assumption challenging prevents "success theater" and ensures that products solve real user problems rather than just shipping features. If a product development process lacks contention, it is likely that the team is missing critical risks or user nuances.

## The Discovery Process

### 1. Identify the "Quiet Room" Risk
Evaluate the current state of your project. If there is no conflict or contention among stakeholders, treat it as a red flag.
- **Check for the "Agreeable MVP":** Are people agreeing because the solution is right, or because they haven't been pushed to find its flaws?
- **Action:** Schedule a "Friction Session" specifically to list everything that could go wrong or reasons why the current path might fail.

### 2. Map Stakeholder Constraints (Empathy Exercise)
Empathy is not just about the user; it is about understanding the internal team. To influence without authority, you must understand the "why" behind their pushback.
- **Identify Constraints:** For your core engineering or design lead, ask:
    - "What does 'impact' look like to you for this quarter?"
    - "What are the technical or resource constraints keeping you up at night?"
    - "Where are we aligned on the goal, but misaligned on the path?"
- **Listen for Cues:** Look for what is *not* being said in meetings. If a leader is quiet, they may have an unexpressed concern about the system's performance or safety.

### 3. Apply the "Rule of 7" for Truth-Seeking
Avoid "dead-end" asynchronous communication that hides underlying disagreements.
- **The Trigger:** If an email or Slack thread reaches **7 to 10 replies** without a resolution, stop typing.
- **The Action:** Immediately get in a room or on a call. 
- **The Goal:** Use the synchronous time to uncover the *actual* disagreement. Asynchronous text often masks the nuance of why an assumption is being challenged.

### 4. Conduct the "Working Backwards" Stress Test
Before building, write the internal press release (PR) or FAQ for the product as if it has already launched.
- **Challenge the Value Prop:** If the PR doesn't sound transformational or solve a specific, painful problem, the product is likely too incremental.
- **Safety/Risk FAQ:** Write the questions you *don't* want to be asked by the public (e.g., "What happens if this fails in the snow?" or "Why is this more expensive than the alternative?"). If you can't answer them, your assumptions are weak.

## Examples

**Example 1: The "Natural" Driving Assumption**
- **Context:** A PM assumes the car should always drive at the maximum safe speed limit to ensure efficiency.
- **Input:** Riders report feeling "uneasy" even though the car is technically safe.
- **Application:** The PM challenges the assumption that "Technically Correct = Good UX." They look at human behavior (slowing down on downhill slopes) and adjust the model to mimic human "social norms" rather than raw efficiency.
- **Output:** A customized braking/speed profile for gradients that increases rider trust by 30%.

**Example 2: The "Agreement" Trap**
- **Context:** A new SaaS feature is approved by all stakeholders in the first meeting.
- **Input:** The PM feels the lack of contention is a sign of complacency.
- **Application:** The PM uses the "Friction Session" to ask: "If we had to cut the budget by 50%, what part of this feature is actually useless?"
- **Output:** The team realizes that 2 of the 4 planned sub-features don't actually solve the core customer problem, allowing them to focus on a "high-bar" MVP instead of a bloated one.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Avoiding Healthy Conflict:** Thinking that a smooth project is a successful one. If there is no contention, you aren't digging deep enough into the technical or market complexities.
- **"Platitude Empathy":** Claiming to "work backwards from the customer" without actually challenging whether your technical solution matches their reality. 
- **Optimizing for Promotion over Impact:** Making decisions based on what looks good for a performance review (e.g., shipping quickly) rather than what is right for the long-term safety or viability of the business.
- **Incrementalism:** Getting so caught up in "human driving data" or existing benchmarks that you fail to see where you need to disrupt your own model before a competitor does.
