name: radical-focus-okr-cadence
description: A framework for aligning teams through outcome-oriented OKRs and a rigorous weekly execution cadence. Use this when a team is spreading themselves too thin (the "peanut butter" effect), lacks a clear definition of success for the quarter, or struggles with "boring" status meetings that focus on tasks rather than impact.
---

The Radical Focus framework moves teams away from "shipping features" and toward "achieving outcomes." It combines inspirational goal-setting with a high-frequency rhythm of accountability and celebration to ensure the most important "big rocks" actually move.

## Core Components of a Radical OKR

### 1. The Objective (The "Why")
The Objective is a qualitative, inspirational, and time-bound goal.
- **Criteria:** It must be memorable and motivating. If your alarm goes off, the Objective should make you want to get out of bed.
- **Avoid:** Boring, task-based objectives like "Ship the v2 update."
- **Example:** "Create a vision for a game that users find truly delightful and we are proud to ship."

### 2. Key Results (The "How do we know?")
Key Results (KRs) quantify the Objective. Use the "Rule of Three" to triangulate success.
- **Brainstorming:** Spend 10 minutes listing every possible way to measure the outcome. The best insights often come after the obvious ideas are exhausted.
- **The Mix:**
  1. **Quantity:** A hardcore number (e.g., Reach, DAU, Sign-ups).
  2. **Quality/Delight:** A "squishy" metric made concrete (e.g., NPS, Metacritic score, customer panel sentiment).
  3. **Value:** A business-driven metric (e.g., Revenue, Retention, Lead conversion).
- **Stretching:** Set KRs that make the team feel "uncomfortable but not doomed." Aim for a 50/50 confidence level at the start.

## The Execution Cadence

OKRs fail without a weekly rhythm. Piggyback on "temporal landmarks" like Mondays and Fridays to create a learning loop.

### Monday: The Commitment Meeting
Keep this to 10-30 minutes. Focus only on the most important initiatives.
- **P1 Priorities:** The 1-3 things that *must* happen this week to move the OKR.
- **P2 Priorities:** Things that *should* happen if time permits.
- **Confidence Scores:** Update the confidence level (1-10) for each KR. If it drops, discuss why and what changed.
- **Health Metrics:** Track 2-3 things you don't want to "break" while chasing the OKR (e.g., "Code Stability," "Team Sanity").

### Friday: The Celebration Session
This is the most undervalued part of the process. It builds a culture of progress.
- **The Prompt:** "What was the most awesome thing that happened in your department this week?"
- **Format:** Demos, screenshots, or stories of wins from Marketing, Design, Engineering, and Product.
- **Purpose:** Makes people feel part of something special and maintains momentum during the "middle-of-the-quarter" slump.

## The Status Update Structure
Use this 4-quadrant format for Slack or email updates to keep the whole company informed:

1. **OKR Status:** List the Objective and 3 KRs with current confidence scores (e.g., 5/10).
2. **Health Metrics:** Green/Yellow/Red status on critical non-OKR items.
3. **This Week's P1s:** The top 3 actions being taken.
4. **Upcoming Big Risks:** Blockers or dependencies that might stop progress.

## Examples

**Example 1: Interior Design Platform**
- **Objective:** Become the go-to source for warm and wonderful home inspiration.
- **KR 1:** 30% of browsing audience converts to registered members.
- **KR 2:** Registered members "favorite" at least 3 items per week.
- **KR 3:** Bi-weekly customer panels show a 4/5 "delight" rating for recommendations.
- **P1 This Week:** Launch A/B test on "Save to Moodboard" CTA; Finalize vendor list for curated gallery.

**Example 2: Warehouse Operations Team**
- **Objective:** Create a warehouse environment that empowers humans through technology.
- **KR 1:** Zero back-related injuries reported this quarter.
- **KR 2:** 20% increase in inventory processing efficiency via robot assistance.
- **KR 3:** 90% of staff report "high satisfaction" with new automated heavy-lifting workflows.
- **P1 This Week:** Complete safety training for Pilot Group A; Deploy 5 robots to Zone 1.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Treating OKRs as a Task List:** KRs must be outcomes. If a KR is "Finish the PRD," it is a task. If it is "PRD approved by the technical review board," it is an outcome.
- **Setting and Forgetting:** If you don't look at OKRs every Monday, you will succumb to the "tomorrow problem" (thinking you'll get to it eventually, but never doing so).
- **The Peanut Butter Memo:** Avoid having 10-20 OKRs. If everything is a priority, nothing is. Stick to one Objective for the team/company per quarter.
- **Low Psychological Safety:** If teams are afraid to say "our confidence has dropped to 2/10," they will lie until the end of the quarter. Reward honesty and the "retrieval practice" of admitting what isn't working.
- **Using OKRs as Medicine:** OKRs won't fix a bad team or a lack of strategy. They are a "vitamin" to supercharge high-performing teams that already have their "shit together."
