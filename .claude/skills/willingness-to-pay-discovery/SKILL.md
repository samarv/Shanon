description: A framework for identifying customer willingness to pay (WTP) and achieving product-market-pricing fit. Use this when prioritizing a product roadmap, validating a new feature idea, or transitioning from a "one-size-fits-all" model to tiered pricing.

## Overview
Pricing is not just a dollar figure; it is a measure of value. Most innovations fail because teams build a product and "slap on a price" at the end. To maximize success, you must design the product around the price by having willingness to pay (WTP) conversations before the product is fully built.

## The WTP Conversation Framework
Conduct these conversations during the discovery phase. Frame questions to extract value perception rather than asking for a specific price point.

### 1. Relative Value Mapping
Humans struggle with absolute numbers but excel at relative comparisons.
- **The Question:** "If [Industry Standard/Competitor] is indexed at 100 in terms of value, where does our product sit?"
- **The Follow-up:** "If their price is indexed at 100, where should our price sit based on that value?"

### 2. Identifying Psychological Thresholds
Identify the "cliffs" in your demand curve where customers drop off.
- **Acceptable Price:** The price where the customer loves both the product and the value. (Ideal for high-growth/no-friction entry).
- **Expensive Price:** The price that feels "neutral." The customer doesn't love it, but they will pay it for the value provided.
- **Prohibitively Expensive Price:** The point where the customer laughs you out of the room.

### 3. Purchase Probability Scale
Quantify the likelihood of conversion. Use a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = Not interested, 5 = Will buy for certain).
- **Heuristic:** Only "5s" are reliable (typically 30-50% of 5s actually buy). "4s" convert at 10-20%. "3s" and below should be treated as non-buyers.
- **Action:** If a user gives a 3, lower the hypothetical price and ask if they move to a 4 or 5.

### 4. Feature Prioritization (Most/Least)
Avoid asking customers to "rank 10 features." They will likely say everything is a "must-have."
- **The Method:** Present a subset of 4-6 features. Ask: "In this set, which is the **most** important (must-have/will pay for) and which is the **least** important (don't need/won't pay for)?"
- **The Output:** Repeat with different subsets to identify the 20% of features that drive 80% of the WTP.

## Product Configuration (Leaders, Fillers, Killers)
Once WTP is understood, organize features into packages based on customer demand.

- **Leaders:** Features that >50% of the market wants and will pay for. These are the core value drivers of the bundle.
- **Fillers:** Features that 20–50% of the market wants. These add "bulk" to the bundle and increase the perceived value for specific segments.
- **Killers:** Features that <20% of the market wants or that "kill" the value of the bundle for everyone else (e.g., adding a niche high-cost feature to a basic plan). These should be sold as **Add-ons**.

## Examples

**Example 1: B2B SaaS Feature Prioritization**
- **Context:** An event platform is deciding whether to build "Multi-ticket types" or "Custom Branding."
- **Input:** Customer interviews using the Most/Least method.
- **Application:** The team discovers that 70% of professional organizers view "Multi-ticket types" as a "Most Important" leader, while "Custom Branding" is a "Least Important" filler.
- **Output:** Multi-ticket types are moved to the core "Pro" plan; Custom Branding is shelved or moved to a "Premium" add-on.

**Example 2: Psychological Threshold for Consumer App**
- **Context:** A premium email app is testing a $30/month price point.
- **Input:** WTP threshold questions.
- **Application:** Data shows a massive drop-off at $31, but no difference in demand between $25 and $29.
- **Output:** The team sets the price at $29.99 to maximize revenue while staying under the $30 psychological cliff.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Pricing Too Late:** Postponing the pricing conversation until after the product is built makes you a "price taker" rather than a "price maker."
- **One Size Fits None:** Building a single "one-size-fits-all" product. This usually over-serves some customers (leaving money on the table) and under-serves others (losing users).
- **Giving the Farm Away:** Including "Killer" features in your entry-level plan. This removes the incentive for users to upgrade.
- **Asking "What would you pay?":** This invites low-balling. Always frame the conversation around value, benefits, and relative comparisons first.
