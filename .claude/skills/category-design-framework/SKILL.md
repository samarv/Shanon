name: category-design-framework
description: A methodology to create and dominate a new market category instead of competing for market share in an existing one. Use this when launching a disruptive product, repositioning a "me-too" product that is stuck in the "Better Trap," or defining a new space in emerging tech (like AI).

# Category Design Framework

Category design is the discipline of creating a new market category and becoming the "Category King." In any given tech category, the leader captures approximately 76% of the total market value. Instead of trying to be "better" than existing competitors, you must be "different" by reframing the problem your product solves.

## 1. Escape the "Better Trap"
Avoid the reflexive urge to compare your product to incumbents. When you say you are "faster," "cheaper," or "better" than a competitor, you validate their category and fight for the remaining 24% of the market.
*   **Reject the Premise:** Stop focusing on features. Features are about the product; categories are about the customer and their problems.
*   **Focus on Differentiation:** If you can't be irreplaceable, you are a commodity.

## 2. The Backcasting Method
Do not forecast the future by looking at the past. Instead, use "backcasting" to unshackle your thinking.
1.  **Envision the Future:** Stand mentally five years in the future where your solution has completely won and changed the world.
2.  **Describe the Reality:** What is the technology doing? How do customers behave? What problems are gone?
3.  **Work Backward:** Looking back from that 5-year vision to today, identify the specific steps and market shifts required to make that future happen.

## 3. Languaging: Frame, Name, and Claim
The company that names the category and defines the problem usually wins. Use "languaging" to change how people think.
*   **Reframe the Problem:** Describe the current "status quo" as a source of pain or inefficiency.
*   **Create New Language:** Invent terms that create a demarcation point in thinking. 
    *   *Example:* Elisha Otis didn't sell a "safe elevator"; he sold a "Vertical Railway."
    *   *Example:* Starbucks didn't sell "large coffee"; they sold a "Venti Latte."
*   **Dam the Demand:** Redirect existing interest. Tell the customer: "You thought you wanted [Old Category], but what you really need is [New Category]."

## 4. Craft the Category Point of View (POV)
Develop a POV document that educates the market. It must follow the "From/To" (Frodo) structure:
1.  **The Context:** Acknowledge the current world.
2.  **The Problem:** Identify a new or ignored problem within the status quo.
3.  **The Vision:** Describe a radically different future.
4.  **The Category:** Name the new space that solves the problem.
5.  **The Call to Action:** Why the customer must move "From" the old way "To" the new way.

## 5. Execute with "Lightning Strikes"
Avoid "peanut butter marketing" (thinly spreading your budget throughout the year). Instead, use the Hollywood movie model:
*   **Concentrate Resources:** Pick 1–2 moments per year to be "undeniable."
*   **Objective:** The goal is not just a demo; it is to establish the category in the mind of the "Super Consumer" (the 10% of users who drive the most profit and zeitgeist).
*   **Drive Word of Mouth (WOM):** Put the right words (your new language) into the right mouths.

## Examples

**Example 1: Lomi (Kitchen Appliance)**
*   **Context:** Scrappy kitchen garbage and environmental waste.
*   **The "Better" Trap:** Trying to build a "faster composter" or "nicer trash can."
*   **Category Design:** Created the "Smart Home Composter."
*   **Reframing:** Instead of "handling garbage," they framed it as "creating nutrient-rich dirt" in 4 hours while saving the planet.

**Example 2: Spinning (Fitness)**
*   **Context:** Outdoor cycling is dangerous and time-consuming.
*   **The "Better" Trap:** Selling a "better exercise bike."
*   **Category Design:** Created "Indoor Cycling Classes."
*   **Damming the Demand:** They told road bikers, "You love the exercise but hate the risk of being hit by a car. Come inside for a class."

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Marketing the Product, Not the Category:** If you focus on your features, you are just an option. If you focus on the category, you are the only solution to the problem you just defined.
*   **Assuming Product-Market Fit is Enough:** Threads (Meta) had massive distribution and "fit," but it failed to define a new problem or category separate from Twitter. It was a "me-too" product.
*   **Using Old Language:** Describing your innovation using the incumbent’s terminology. This keeps you trapped in their category.
*   **Being "First to Ship" instead of "First to Mind":** Category Kings aren't always the first to invent the tech, but they are the first to design the category and capture the consumer's brain.
