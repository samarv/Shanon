# Bottom-Up GTM for Technical Products

This framework focuses on winning the hearts of practitioners first to bypass traditional top-down sales hurdles. By building deep credibility with individual contributors (ICs) and removing friction for sharing, you turn your users into your most effective sales force.

## Phase 1: Win IC Love

Technical users have a high "bullshit meter." You cannot market your way to their approval; you must earn it through technical excellence and authenticity.

### 1. Build Extreme Credibility
*   **Avoid "Marketer Speak":** Remove buzzwords like "efficiency" or "synergy." Use the specific technical language of the craft (e.g., "vector networks," "WebGL," "autolayout").
*   **Produce "Un-writable" Content:** Write technical deep-dives that a generalist marketer could not produce. If the marketing team can write it without interviewing an engineer or designer, it is too basic.
*   **Show the Work:** Publish post-mortems for downtime and deep-dives into how specific features were engineered.

### 2. Build With Your Users
*   **Immediate Feedback Loops:** In the early stages, have engineers and founders handle support. Debug live with users in chat.
*   **The "Little Big Updates" Pattern:** Periodically package 10–20 small quality-of-life improvements (one-click fixes) into a single launch. Tag the specific users who requested each feature to show you are listening.
*   **Do Not Scale Too Early:** Drive to a customer's office to fix their specific hardware issues if necessary to keep the first 10 users active.

### 3. Occupy Existing Channels
*   **Identify the "Home" Channel:** Find where your audience already lives (e.g., Twitter, Discord, Stack Overflow). 
*   **Personal Presence:** Have leadership and engineers post from personal accounts, not just the brand handle. Interact as humans, not a corporation.
*   **Influence Mapping:** Identify key practitioners in sub-niches. Ask them for feedback on the product rather than asking them to promote it.

## Phase 2: Enable Organizational Spread

Once ICs love the tool, remove the barriers that prevent them from bringing it to their bosses.

### 1. Remove Sharing Friction
*   **Collaborator-First Pricing:** Structure your free tier to allow unlimited viewers and collaborators. Charge for editors or advanced organizational features, never for the "spread" itself.
*   **The Three-File Limit:** Use a "starter" tier that offers limited files but unlimited collaborators. This allows a team to build confidence in the tool's multiplayer utility before they hit a paywall.

### 2. Turn Blockers into Levers
*   **Identify Friction Points:** Find the one thing stopping a company from switching (e.g., Design Systems, Security, Asset Management).
*   **Target the Operational Layer:** Build features specifically for the "system builders" (e.g., Design Systems Leads). If you win the person responsible for the company’s internal standards, the rest of the company follows.

### 3. Deploy Technical Advocates (The "Tom Factor")
*   **Hire Practitioner Advocates:** Hire respected members of the community to join the marketing/sales team. They should not have sales quotas.
*   **Integrate Advocates in Sales:** Bring these advocates into sales calls to speak peer-to-peer with the prospect’s technical team. Their goal is to solve technical blockers and share best practices, not to "close" the deal.

## Examples

**Example 1: Winning the First Champion**
*   **Context:** A small startup is trying to get a large design team to switch from a legacy desktop tool.
*   **Input:** A designer at the target company expresses interest but is worried about the tool's stability.
*   **Application:** The CEO and lead engineer drive to the prospect's office. When a file fails to open on one engineer's specific MacBook model, the lead engineer stays on-site to debug the hardware compatibility live.
*   **Output:** The company becomes the first "full-time" user because the team trusts the founders will never let them fail.

**Example 2: Leveraging Design Systems for Expansion**
*   **Context:** A product is used by 50 individual designers on different teams, but the VP of Design won't sign a site-wide contract.
*   **Input:** The company struggles with UI consistency across different departments.
*   **Application:** The GTM team launches a "Design Systems" feature that allows one team to publish a library that others can subscribe to. They host a "Schema" conference specifically for the people who build these systems.
*   **Output:** The Design Systems leads become the internal "super-spreaders," forcing the VP to upgrade to the Enterprise tier to manage the shared libraries across the whole org.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Hiding Behind the Brand:** During a crisis or downtime, companies often go silent or post corporate platitudes. **Instead:** Have the CEO or CTO hold a live, transparent Q&A (e.g., a Twitter Space or Webinar) to take direct accountability.
*   **Optimizing Metrics Over Signal:** Trying to A/B test a landing page before you have 10 users who love the product. **Instead:** Ignore the "5% lift" and focus on getting one person to pull the laptop out of your hands because they want to play with the tool.
*   **Charging for Viewers:** Putting a paywall on the "view-only" experience. **Why it’s a mistake:** This kills the viral loop. **Instead:** Let the whole company see the work for free so that every stakeholder becomes a potential advocate for the tool's utility.
*   **The "Marketer Gap":** Hiring a traditional salesperson who can't actually use the product at a high level. **Instead:** Ensure every person in a customer-facing role can actually build something in the tool they are selling.
