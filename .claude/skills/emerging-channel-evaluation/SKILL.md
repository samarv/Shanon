# Emerging Channel Evaluation Framework

This framework prevents "shiny object syndrome" by vetting new acquisition opportunities against customer needs, platform maturity, and company resource constraints. Use it to decide which channels to ignore, which to "fish" in for signal, and which to scale.

## The Three Core Ingredients

Before committing resources, analyze the potential channel through these three lenses:

### 1. The Strategic Overlap
Identify if there is a fundamental alignment between the channel's unique strengths and your current objectives.
- **Channel Strength:** What does the platform do better than anyone else? (e.g., Clubhouse = live audio, TikTok = short-form entertainment, Influencers = hyper-contextual targeting).
- **Customer Need:** Does the channel’s primary use case solve a discovery or engagement problem for your user?
- **Company Goal:** Does the channel's output map to your KPIs (e.g., brand awareness, new user acquisition, or retention)?
- **Action:** Only proceed if all three circles overlap. For example, Spotify (Goal: Audio engagement) should prioritize Clubhouse (Strength: Live audio) over a photo-first app like Paparazzi.

### 2. Channel DNA & Monetization
Evaluate the platform's trajectory and how you can "hack" their business goals to your advantage.
- **Maturity Risk:** If the channel is very early, expect high volatility. Be prepared for the "Zynga/Facebook" effect where a platform pulls the plug on a growth lever overnight.
- **Monetization Alignment:** Determine how the platform makes money. If you can help them prove their ad model, you gain leverage.
  - *Strategy:* Approach the platform as an Alpha tester. Offer to be a case study in exchange for custom support or early access to ad products.
- **Example:** Hotel Tonight succeeded on Facebook's early mobile ads because they offered to be a "travel" case study when Facebook was over-reliant on "gaming" revenue.

### 3. Company DNA & Readiness
Assess if your organization can actually handle the friction of a new channel.
- **Risk Profile:** Are you willing to show up next to offensive content or deal with broken tracking? 
- **Staffing:** Do you have at least "half a person" to dedicate to this without distracting from foundation channels?
- **Current Mix:** Do not chase emerging channels until you have established some volume on "foundation" channels (Google/Meta).

## Execution Guidelines

### The "Fishing" Phase (1 Month)
- Spend 2–4 weeks putting "bait in the water."
- Do not look for statistical significance; look for **momentum**.
- Define success metrics beforehand: Is it clicks, room size growth, or qualitative engagement?

### The Evaluation Phase (1 Quarter)
- If a channel shows "magic" during fishing, move to a quarterly test.
- **Cap the investment:** If you don't see a clear path to repeatability or scaling within 3 months, put the channel back on ice.
- **Content Cost:** Factor in production time. If a channel requires high-spec video (like OTT/Streaming TV), allow more time for the test than a text-based channel.

## Examples

**Example 1: High Alignment (Audio Product)**
- **Context:** A music discovery app evaluating a new live-audio social platform.
- **Input:** Customer wants discovery; Company wants retention; Channel offers live artist Q&As.
- **Application:** Use the "Strategic Overlap" lens. The medium (audio) matches the product.
- **Output:** Greenlight for a 1-month "fishing" test with 2 live sessions per week.

**Example 2: Leveraging Platform Goals (B2B Travel)**
- **Context:** A B2B travel startup evaluating a new ad network.
- **Input:** The network is desperate to prove they aren't just for "hardcore gamers."
- **Application:** Use the "Channel DNA" lens. Position the startup as the "Travel Category Leader" for the network's launch.
- **Output:** Negotiate Alpha access and lower CPMs in exchange for a co-marketing case study.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **The PMF Assumption:** Never assume you have Product-Market Fit in a new channel. The market conditions and audience on a new platform are different; start by assuming you are starting from zero.
- **Treating Podcasts like Direct Response:** Avoid treating podcast ads like Facebook ads. Successful podcasting requires "radio-style" thinking: repetitive, personal host-reads rather than one-off transactional "buy now" ads.
- **Over-Engineering Early:** Don't build custom tech/tracking for a channel until you've proven the audience exists. Manual work (sending emails, manual spreadsheets) is preferred during the "fishing" phase.
- **Ignoring the T-Shape:** Don't assign a specialist in "Search" to lead a "TikTok" experiment. Ensure the person leading the test has the right "T-shaped" skills for that specific medium (e.g., video storytelling).
