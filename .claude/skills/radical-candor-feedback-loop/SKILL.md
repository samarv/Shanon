description: A framework for improving team performance and relationships through Radical Candor (Caring Personally + Challenging Directly). Use this when conducting 1:1s, addressing performance issues, or soliciting peer feedback to avoid Ruinous Empathy and Obnoxious Aggression.
---

Radical Candor is the result of caring personally while challenging directly. Use this framework to build relationship hygiene, ensure high performance, and avoid the "Bob" trap—where failing to give feedback leads to eventual firing.

## The Radical Candor 2x2
Evaluate your communication against these quadrants:
- **Radical Candor:** Care Personally + Challenge Directly.
- **Obnoxious Aggression:** Challenge Directly without Caring Personally (acting like a jerk).
- **Ruinous Empathy:** Caring Personally without Challenging Directly (avoiding hard truths to stay "nice").
- **Manipulative Insincerity:** Neither caring nor challenging (self-protective silence or backstabbing).

## 1. Solicit Feedback (Start Here)
Before giving feedback, you must prove you can take it. Never ask, "Do you have any feedback for me?" as it results in useless "everything's fine" responses.

### The Go-To Question
Ask a specific, open-ended question that demands a response. Use a phrase authentic to you:
- "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?"
- "What is one thing I could have done this week to better support you?"
- "Tell me why I'm wrong about [Project X]."

### The Protocol
1. **Embrace the Discomfort:** After asking, close your mouth and count to six. Most people will offer an insight just to break the silence.
2. **Listen to Understand:** Do not get defensive. Ask follow-up questions like "Who do you wish I were in that situation?" to find the root cause.
3. **Reward the Candor:** 
   - If you agree: Fix the problem immediately and make the change visible ("So-and-so told me X, so I did Y").
   - If you disagree: Find the 5–10% you *do* agree with, then schedule a follow-up to offer a respectful explanation of why you disagree.

## 2. Deliver Feedback (HIP CORE)
Use the HIP CORE framework for both praise and criticism. Praise should be more frequent than criticism but never delivered as a "shit sandwich" (praise-criticism-praise).

### The HIP Principles
- **Humble:** It's candor, not "the truth." You might be wrong.
- **Helpful:** State your intention to help the person succeed.
- **Immediate:** Don't save feedback for a 1:1 or performance review. Give it as soon as you have two minutes.
- **In-person/Synchronous:** Deliver via phone or video. Slack and email are "feedback train wrecks" because you cannot gauge how the message lands.
- **Public/Private:** Praise in public; criticize in private.
- **Not Personality:** Never make it about the person’s character (e.g., "You're lazy").

### The CORE Template
Structure the conversation using these four steps:
- **Context:** Where and when did it happen?
- **Observation:** What specific behavior did you see?
- **Result:** What was the impact on the team/project?
- **E (Next Steps):** What should they do differently next time?

## Examples

**Example 1: Correcting a Presentation Habit**
- **Context:** "In the meeting with the founders this morning..."
- **Observation:** "...you said 'um' every third word."
- **Result:** "It made you sound less confident and undermined your great data."
- **Next Step:** "I know a speech coach Google pays for; would you like an intro?"

**Example 2: Praising Strategic Thinking**
- **Context:** "During the roadmap review..."
- **Observation:** "...you proactively shared the downsides of your own proposal."
- **Result:** "It built massive credibility with the engineering leads and saved us three weeks of debate."
- **Next Step:** "Continue being that transparent in high-stakes meetings."

## Common Pitfalls
- **The "Spirit of Radical Candor" Jerk:** Do not use the term as a license to be a jerk (Obnoxious Aggression). If the listener looks "mad or sad," you must move up the "Care Personally" axis.
- **Pulling Punches:** When a person looks sad, do not take back the words or say "it's no big deal." If it's a big deal, they need to know.
- **False Harmony:** Prioritizing "niceness" over clarity. Remember: "It's not mean; it's clear."
- **Over-scheduling:** If you are back-to-back, you will skip the two-minute feedback moments. Schedule "slack time" or be willing to be two minutes late to your next meeting to deliver immediate guidance.
