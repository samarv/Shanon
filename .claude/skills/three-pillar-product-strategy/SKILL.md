Product strategy is the connective tissue between high-level business goals (like revenue targets) and specific product features. This framework ensures your strategy provides an inspiring vision while remaining grounded in execution reality.

## The Three Pillars of Strategy

A complete strategy must contain these three components to be effective for all stakeholders.

### 1. The Vision (The "Where")
An inspiring, high-level picture of what the future looks like once your product succeeds.
*   **Goal:** Recruitment and inspiration.
*   **Action:** Paint a picture of the world in 2-5 years. What is the "ambient" experience of the user?
*   **Example:** Asana’s vision of a "Team Brain" where teams have ambient awareness of each other’s work without manual status updates.

### 2. The Strategic Framework (The "How")
The unique breakdown of the problem and the specific choices made to win.
*   **Market Selection:** Exactly which customers are you going after?
*   **Success Metrics:** What does winning look like in measurable terms?
*   **Big Bets (Pillars):** 3-5 high-level themes that define your approach to the market.
*   **Action:** Connect the dots between a business goal (e.g., "Increase revenue by 50%") and product work. Explain *why* certain features will drive that goal (e.g., "We will reach the revenue goal by increasing expansion within current accounts rather than acquiring new ones because our market is currently saturated").

### 3. The Roadmap (The "When")
A backward-mapped timeline used as a feasibility check, not a fixed commitment.
*   **The Feasibility Test:** Work backward from your 5-year vision. If your current pace makes the vision look like a 30-year project, your strategy is flawed.
*   **Adjustment Mechanism:** Use the roadmap to identify where you need "bigger swings," more resources, or to say "no" to optional work to hit the vision in the desired timeframe.
*   **Cross-functional Alignment:** Use the roadmap to tell Marketing when they need a new launch plan or Finance when a new business model must be ready.

## Strategy Development Process

### The 6-Month Rule
New PMs should not attempt to rewrite strategy immediately. 
1.  **Months 0-6:** Focus on learning. Talk to customers, analyze data, and deliver on the *existing* strategy.
2.  **Month 6+:** Block off a half-day of deep work. Draft the first version of your own strategic pillars based on the trends and pain points you observed.

### Identifying Strategy Gaps
Look for "repeated disagreements" within the product triad (PM, Design, Engineering). 
*   If you find yourselves fighting over the same feature for weeks, it is a sign of a missing strategic principle.
*   **Action:** Instead of debating the feature, write down the underlying strategic choice (e.g., "We prioritize consistency over comprehensiveness") to resolve all future similar conflicts.

## Examples

**Example 1: The "Team Brain" (Coordination Software)**
*   **Vision:** A world where work is effortless because the "brain" knows who is doing what.
*   **Strategic Framework:** Focus on "Work about Work." The pillar is "Automated Status."
*   **Action:** Instead of just adding a "Comments" feature, the strategy dictates building a centralized notification system that updates automatically when a task is completed.
*   **Output:** All features are filtered through: "Does this reduce manual status reporting?"

**Example 2: Search Results (Marketplace)**
*   **Context:** Deciding whether to show external results (e.g., linking from YouTube to Hulu).
*   **Strategic Framework Choice:** Consistency vs. Comprehensiveness.
*   **Application:** If the strategy is *Consistency*, the product only shows internal content to ensure a uniform player experience. If *Comprehensiveness*, it links out to ensure the user always finds the video they want.
*   **Output:** A clear rule that allows the team to ship features without asking leadership for permission on every new link.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Confusing Goals with Strategy:** Setting a target like "Increase revenue by 50%" is a goal, not a strategy. A strategy explains the *how* and the *why* behind reaching that number.
*   **Strategy in a Vacuum:** PMs often try to "invent" strategy alone. Strategy must be collaborative. Use stakeholders to stress-test your assumptions.
*   **Ignoring Confusion:** If stakeholders are confused by your plan, it means you have a "missing dot" in your logic. Don't push through; find the assumption they don't share and address it.
*   **The "Static" Roadmap:** Treating the strategic roadmap as a list of promised ship dates. It should be used to realize that your current plan is too slow for your vision, triggering a change in approach.
