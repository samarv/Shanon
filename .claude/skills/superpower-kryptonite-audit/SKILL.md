# Superpower and Kryptonite Audit

This framework helps you move beyond generic strengths (like "strategic" or "hardworking") to identify the specific narrative themes that drive your success. By treating your career as a "story-driven" journey, you can amplify your natural advantages and reframe your "kryptonite" as a functional tool rather than a failure.

## 1. Identify Your Superpowers
Do not use multiple-choice tests; they lack context. Instead, extract your superpowers by overlaying three distinct "peak experiences" to find recurring themes.

### The Peak Experience Exercise
Identify three stories from your life where you were "at your best" or "totally lit up."
1.  **The Childhood Spark:** A project or activity from your youth that energized you.
2.  **The Recent Win:** A work project from the last 5–10 years where you felt most effective.
3.  **The Meandering Path:** Look at the transitions in your career. What specific skill enabled you to jump from one role to the next?

**Analysis Questions:**
- What specific action was I taking when the impact was made? (e.g., "I wasn't just 'managing,' I was 'connecting' disparate ideas.")
- What was the common theme across all three stories?
- How does this superpower give me energy?

## 2. Reframe Your Kryptonite
Kryptonite is not just a weakness to be fixed; it is often a trait that serves a hidden function. Use the "Head, Heart, Hands" filter to evaluate your perceived flaws.

### Categorize Your Kryptonite
- **Operational Kryptonite:** Administrative or logistical tasks that zap your energy (e.g., scheduling, spreadsheets). **Strategy:** Automate, outsource, or delegate immediately. Do not try to "fix" these.
- **Inner Kryptonite:** Internal traits or "horror stories" you tell yourself (e.g., "I'm an imposter," "I'm too quiet," "I'm too nice"). **Strategy:** Reframe using the "Functional Inquiry."

### The Functional Inquiry
Ask: **"How is this trait serving me?"**
- **Example (Imposter Syndrome):** It serves as a growth signal. It triggers you to read 20 books and work 10x harder to master a new domain.
- **Example (Anger/The Hulk):** It provides the energy needed to break through bureaucratic blockers.
- **Example (Being "Too Quiet"):** It allows for deep listening and spatial processing before making a decision.

## 3. Run "In-the-Room" Experiments
Once you identify a superpower or a reframed kryptonite, test it with a micro-experiment before committing to a major behavioral change.

1.  **The 30-Second Roleplay:** If you want to test "Deep Listening" as a superpower, try sitting in a meeting for 30 seconds without speaking.
2.  **The Body Scan:** During the experiment, check your "Hands." Is your face turning red? Are your shoulders tensing?
3.  **The "Isn't That Interesting?" Stance:** Adopt a non-judgmental awareness. If an experiment feels "terrifying," don't label it bad. Ask, "Isn't it interesting that my body reacts this way to silence?"

## Examples

**Example 1: The "Too Nice" CEO**
- **Context:** A founder believes they are failing because they are "too nice" and people don't take them seriously.
- **Audit:** Data from the team reveals the CEO isn't "too nice"—they are "heartfelt and caring," which is why superstars joined the company.
- **Reframing:** The perceived weakness (niceness) is actually a recruitment superpower. The real issue was a lack of clear vision, not a lack of "toughness."
- **Output:** The CEO stops trying to be a "jerk" and instead doubles down on communicating a grand vision while letting the senior team handle the tactics.

**Example 2: The "Quiet" Executive**
- **Context:** An executive is told she needs to "speak up more" in 360 reviews.
- **Audit:** She realizes her peak experiences involve "Connecting Ideas," which requires 2 hours of processing after a meeting.
- **Reframing:** She isn't "disengaged"; she is a "Deep Processor."
- **Output:** She writes a "Personal README" for her team: *"I process slowly to ensure I'm connecting all the dots. I will rarely speak in the moment, but I will provide a synthesized strategy 4 hours later."*

## Common Pitfalls
- **Using Generic Labels:** Avoid calling your superpower "Strategy." Be specific: "I am a connector of disparate people" or "I am an adaptor who thrives in chaos."
- **The "Fix-It" Trap:** Spending 80% of your time trying to fix a weakness (like email management) instead of spending 80% of your time on your superpower.
- **Ignoring the Body:** Trying to "think" your way into a new leadership style while ignoring the fact that the style makes you feel physically ill or "numb."
- **Over-Indexing:** Using a superpower (like problem-solving) so much that you become a bottleneck by solving everyone else's problems instead of leading.---
