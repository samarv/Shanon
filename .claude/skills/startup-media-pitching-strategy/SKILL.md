# Startup Media Pitching Strategy

Press coverage is not a service provided to you; it is a resource you provide to a publication's audience. To get covered, you must stop telling success stories and start telling problem-solving stories that offer value, insights, or counter-intuitive lessons to readers.

## Phase 1: Strategic Preparation

Before reaching out to any journalist, define your tactical objective and refine your narrative.

### 1. Identify the Goal
Do not seek press for the sake of "awareness." Identify a specific business need:
*   **Customer Acquisition:** Targeting publications your buyers read (e.g., local food blogs for a food truck).
*   **Investor Validation:** Seeking "social cachet" from major titles (e.g., TechCrunch, Wall Street Journal) to include in pitch decks or "As Seen In" website banners.
*   **Positioning:** Establishing an executive as an authority to get invited to conferences or partner meetings.

### 2. Decode the Publication's Mission
Read the publication to understand their internal logic. Different titles require different story angles for the same product:
*   **Entrepreneur:** Focuses on "thinking" and "problem-solving." They want to know how you solved a counter-intuitive internal business challenge.
*   **Fast Company:** Focuses on the "evolution of business." They want to know how your company represents a shift in industry trends.
*   **Consumer Titles (e.g., Cosmo, Men's Health):** Focuses on "roundups." They want to know if your product fits a seasonal or topical list (e.g., "10 Best Snacks for Fall").

### 3. Move From "Success" to "Problem-Solving"
Journalists find success stories boring. They want the "Hero's Journey":
*   **Bad Narrative:** "We worked hard and now we have 100k users."
*   **Good Narrative:** "We faced a $10,000 market research bill we couldn't afford, so we spent 12 hours a day at airport gates interviewing bored travelers for free. Here is what we learned about our customers."

## Phase 2: Targeted Prospecting

### Find the Right Person
*   **Avoid the Editor-in-Chief:** They manage the brand, not the stories.
*   **Identify Beat Reporters:** Search the publication for your category (e.g., "remote work," "SaaS," "hospitality") and find the writers who consistently cover those topics.
*   **The Freelancer Advantage:** Freelancers are "hungrier" for stories because they must pitch editors to get paid. If a freelancer likes your story, they will do the work of selling it to the editor for you.
*   **Check Author Bios:** Click the byline. If it doesn't say "Staff," Google the name to find their portfolio.

### The "Recognition" Pre-Game
Before pitching, engage with the journalist on social media (X, Instagram, or LinkedIn).
*   Reply to their stories or posts in a non-promotional way.
*   Goal: Make your name recognizable so they don't treat your email as a "mass blast."

## Phase 3: The Pitch

### The Email Structure
Limit the pitch to three paragraphs. Use a human, non-automated tone.

1.  **The Hook:** Reference a specific piece of their previous work to prove you aren't mass-blasting.
2.  **The Story (The Problem/Solution):** Use bullet points to outline a specific challenge you faced and the clever way you solved it.
3.  **The Value Prop:** Explicitly state why this story is useful to *their* specific audience.

### Alternative Strategies
If your company is "boring" or B2B-heavy, use these "Context" strategies:
*   **The Trend-Jack:** Pitch yourself as an expert who can provide a quote on a breaking news item.
*   **The Proprietary Report:** Use your company's internal data to create a "State of the Industry" report (e.g., "The Top 10 Fastest Growing Apps of 2024").
*   **The Narrative Trend:** Pitch a story about a larger industry shift (e.g., "Why 5 startups are now focusing on death-tech") and include yourself as one of the examples.

## Examples

### Example 1: The "Problem-Solver" Pitch
**Context:** A Canadian landscape painter (Meg O'Hara) lost her B2B ski resort business due to COVID border closures.
**The Pitch:** She emailed the "Problem Solvers" podcast.
*   **Subject:** Idea for Problem Solvers: How border closures grew my business.
*   **The Story:** Ski resorts closed (Problem) -> High-income skiers were stuck at home with disposable income (Insight) -> She pivoted to selling direct-to-consumer paintings of those skiers' favorite views (Solution).
**Result:** A featured podcast episode and magazine coverage.

### Example 2: The "Systemic Scam" Pitch
**Context:** A cat toy creator (Fred Ruckel) was being ripped off by arbitrageurs.
**The Pitch:** He moved from pitching his product to pitching an investigative story.
*   **The Story:** "If you want to learn about a gigantic scam on Amazon and eBay where people are stealing my listings and overcharging customers, let me know."
**Result:** A 4,000-word investigative feature where the founder was the primary protagonist.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Treating Journalists as Service Providers:** Never ask "How do I get a feature?" Instead, ask "Would your readers find this lesson on [Topic] useful?"
*   **The Press Release Trap:** Do not pay for wire distribution (e.g., PRWeb). Appearing on "Yahoo Finance" via a wire service provides zero traffic and zero credibility; it is a vanity metric.
*   **Being Cagey:** If you aren't willing to talk about your failures, mistakes, or specific numbers, the journalist will lose interest. Stories require conflict.
*   **Using Boring Subject Lines:** Avoid "Press Release: [Company] Announces New President." Nobody cares. Use "How we solved [Specific Industry Problem]" instead.
*   **Ignoring the "As Seen In" Value:** Don't be disappointed if a story doesn't drive immediate sales. Use the logo on your website and promote the link via paid social to target investors—this is often more valuable than the initial readership.
