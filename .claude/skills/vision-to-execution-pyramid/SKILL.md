description: A framework for translating high-level product vision into actionable goals and execution steps. Use this when defining a new product direction, aligning cross-functional teams, or setting quarterly OKRs to ensure daily tasks ladder up to long-term strategy.

The Vision-to-Execution Pyramid prevents strategy from becoming "too abstract" by connecting a 10-year horizon to immediate features. Use this workflow to build team buy-in and maintain high product quality throughout the development cycle.

## The Strategy Pyramid
Organize your thinking from top to bottom. Each layer must explicitly support the one above it.

1.  **Vision (10-Year Horizon):** The existential "north star." What does the world look like if you succeed?
2.  **Mission:** The level of abstraction that describes *how* you make that vision come to life.
3.  **Strategy:** The specific choices and paths you take to execute the mission.
4.  **Objectives/OKRs (3–6 Months):** Clear, measurable notes that the team must hit to fulfill the strategy.

## The Collaborative Planning Process
Strategy should not be created in a vacuum or decided by a democratic vote. It requires a "benevolent dictator" approach fueled by cross-functional input.

### 1. Conduct Cross-Functional Brainstorms
*   **The Format:** Use a digital whiteboard (FigJam/Miro/MURAL).
*   **The Invitees:** Go beyond the core team. Include Marketing, Policy, and Ops to capture different signals.
*   **The Prompts:**
    *   "Where do we see this product in 10 years?"
    *   "What is the competitive landscape doing that could influence us?"
    *   "What moments in our customer's journey have brought them the most joy?"
*   **The Synthesis:** Do not try to finalize the vision in the meeting. Collect ideas, bucket them into concepts, then draft the vision independently for later feedback.

### 2. Set Balanced Quality Metrics
Avoid "empty growth" by pairing growth metrics with quality "seesaws."
*   **Identify the value moment:** For Airbnb Experiences, it was the "Review Rate." For Etsy, it was "First Sale within 7 Days."
*   **Implement friction if necessary:** If growth is tanking quality, add friction (e.g., slowing down onboarding to ensure sellers set up higher-quality shops).

## The 3-Gate Product Review
Maintain quality without becoming a bottleneck by implementing three specific check-in moments for every major feature.

### Gate 1: First Principles (The "What & Why")
*   **Goal:** Align on the problem before any design starts.
*   **Key Question:** Are we solving the right thing?
*   **Output:** Agreement on the foundation. This prevents "wasted work" where teams build the wrong solution beautifully.

### Gate 2: The Approach (The "How")
*   **Goal:** Review the design and technical architecture.
*   **Key Question:** Does this approach effectively solve the problem defined in Gate 1?
*   **Checklist:** Review technical infrastructure, edge cases, and user flow.

### Gate 3: Ready to Ship (The "Quality Bar")
*   **Goal:** Final sign-off.
*   **Key Question:** Does this meet our rigorous quality standards?
*   **Rule:** Use a "Two-Way Door" policy. If a decision is easily reversible, skip this gate to move faster. If it's a "One-Way Door" (high impact, hard to reverse), this gate is mandatory.

## Examples

**Example 1: Balancing Growth and Success**
*   **Context:** Improving Etsy's seller onboarding.
*   **Input:** High volume of new shops opening, but low retention.
*   **Application:** Defined a quality metric: "First sale within 7 days."
*   **Output:** Added friction to the onboarding flow, requiring sellers to be more thoughtful about listings. New shop numbers dropped, but successful, long-term seller growth increased.

**Example 2: Establishing High-Quality Standards**
*   **Context:** Launching Airbnb Experiences.
*   **Input:** Need to define what makes a "good" experience before scaling.
*   **Application:** Conducted a "One-Way Door" decision process over several months to define host standards.
*   **Output:** A set of rigorous standards that influenced product education, host coaching, and the global review system.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Strategy in a Vacuum:** Leaders writing docs alone. Result: The team doesn't understand or care about the "why."
*   **Democratic Strategy:** Voting on the direction. Result: A "watered down" strategy that lacks a clear, decisive edge.
*   **Ignoring Second-Order Thinking:** Failing to ask, "If we change X today, what does it break in 6 months?"
*   **Gate Bloat:** Requiring a full leadership review for "Two-Way Door" decisions. Result: Stifled autonomy and slow shipping speeds.
