# The Unifying Concept Framework for Product Expansion

A common mistake in product expansion is assuming that high engagement in one service (e.g., ride-hailing) automatically grants permission to sell any other service (e.g., financial top-ups or massages). This framework helps you identify the "unifying concept" that dictates whether a new product will feel intuitive to your users or create friction and brand confusion.

## Core Principles

### Identify the "Anchor" Concept
The success of a multi-product app depends on the single mental model the user has for your service. 
- **The Driver Concept:** For Gojek, users viewed the app as "A person on a motorcycle who can do things for me."
- **The Utility Concept:** If a user views your app as a specific tool (e.g., "The way I get to work"), they will struggle to discover or trust unrelated services.

### Test for Intuitive Discovery
Cross-selling fails when it requires heavy customer education. If a user doesn't intuitively associate your "anchor" with the new service, discoverability will remain low even with prime UI real estate.

## The Application Process

### 1. Define Your Current Anchor
Identify the core physical or digital entity the user interacts with. 
- Is it a person (driver, courier, stylist)?
- Is it a specific asset (a car, a house, a bank account)?
- Is it a specific action (sending a message, paying a bill)?

### 2. Map the "Permission" Radius
List potential services and ask: "Does the user believe the Anchor is capable of this?"
- **High Permission:** A driver can carry a person, a package, or a meal. (Low CAC, high adoption).
- **Low Permission:** A driver is not expected to be a masseuse or a financial advisor. (High CAC, low trust).

### 3. Conduct the "Discovery Gap" Audit
If an existing sub-service has low adoption, use this specific UXR sequence:
1. **Identify the Need:** Confirm if the user actually needs the service (e.g., "Do you use prepaid phone minutes?").
2. **The Awareness Question:** "Do you know you can do [Service X] inside our app?"
3. **The 'Why' Investigation:** If they knew it existed but didn't use it, determine if the "Unifying Concept" is broken (e.g., "I didn't think a driver would be good at that").

### 4. Evaluate Design Constraints
Avoid the "Giant Grid of Buttons" trap. If you have more than six services, your UI will likely devolve into a menu that limits your ability to create a specialized, high-quality experience for any single service.

## Examples

**Example 1: Logical Extension**
- **Context:** An on-demand motorcycle ride-hailing app (Gojek) wants to launch food delivery.
- **Anchor:** The Driver.
- **Unifying Concept:** "A guy on a bike who can move things."
- **Result:** High success. Users intuitively understand that the same person who gives them a ride can pick up a bag of food.

**Example 2: Concept Breakage**
- **Context:** The same app launches on-demand massages.
- **Anchor:** The Driver.
- **User Reaction:** Confusion. Users asked, "Is the driver going to come into my house and give me a massage?"
- **Result:** Failure. The user's mental model of a "driver" did not include "trained medical/wellness professional," creating a trust barrier that UI and discounts couldn't fix.

## Common Pitfalls

- **The "Strategy Deck" Mirage:** Don't be swayed by "lower CAC" or "higher retention" metrics in pitch decks. These only manifest if the unifying concept holds.
- **The Eyeball Fallacy:** Assuming that 10 million users seeing a button equals 10 million potential customers. If the button doesn't match the user's "job to be done" for that app session, they will suffer from functional blindness.
- **Ignoring Cultural Artifacts:** Failing to see how users *actually* use your product. Gojek noticed users sending food as gifts to romantic interests and built "Far-Away Delivery" to support that specific cultural behavior.
- **Over-Bundling:** Adding services that require different trust levels. High-frequency, low-trust services (rides) rarely mix well with low-frequency, high-trust services (medical, legal) without a massive brand shift.
