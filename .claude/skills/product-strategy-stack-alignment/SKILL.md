description: A 5-level framework to connect company mission to daily execution. Use this when your team is struggling to prioritize between two similar features, when there is a disconnect between high-level goals and the roadmap, or when you need to "debug" why specific product goals are not being met.

The Product Strategy Stack is a system for separating and aligning the five components of product work: Mission, Company Strategy, Product Strategy, Roadmap, and Goals. It prevents the common mistake of conflating these terms and ensures every tactical task serves a logical strategic purpose.

## The Strategy Stack Layers

1.  **Company Mission:** The qualitative, aspirational change the company wants to bring to the world (e.g., Tinder: "Make single life more fun").
2.  **Company Strategy:** The rigorously logical plan to achieve that mission, including target audiences and monetization models.
3.  **Product Strategy:** The connective tissue that defines how the product specifically will fulfill the company strategy (e.g., Hinge’s strategy to focus on deep profiles rather than fast swipes).
4.  **Product Roadmap:** The sequence of features and experiences that implement the product strategy.
5.  **Product Goals:** The quantitative metrics used to measure the success of the roadmap (e.g., meaningful conversations, retention, or bookings).

## How to Apply the Framework

### Top-Down: For Planning and Prioritization
Use this flow when starting a new initiative or planning a quarter to ensure alignment.
*   **Define the Mission/Vision:** State the purpose. If words are too vague, create low-fidelity wireframes to visualize the "end state."
*   **Validate Strategy Logic:** Ensure the plan is "rigorously logical" rather than just aspirational.
*   **Derive the Roadmap:** List the features necessary to fulfill the strategy.
*   **Assign Goals Last:** Set metrics only after the destination (strategy) and path (roadmap) are clear.

### Bottom-Up: For Debugging Performance
Use this flow when a team is underperforming or features are launching without impact.
*   **Check the Goals:** Are you missing your targets?
*   **Evaluate the Roadmap:** Is the roadmap actually designed to move those specific goals?
*   **Question the Product Strategy:** If the roadmap is solid but goals aren't moving, is the underlying strategy flawed or unarticulated?
*   **Review Company Alignment:** Does the product strategy still serve the broader company mission?

## Implementation Guidelines

### Use "Visual Strategy"
Do not rely on words alone. Visuals create a "blueprint" that prevents multiple interpretations of the same strategy.
*   **Sketch Wireframes:** Even if you lack a designer, use tools like Balsamiq or hand-drawn sketches to show the conceptual layout.
*   **Define the Nav Bar:** A mobile app can usually only have 4-5 core items. Deciding what these are is a strategic act, not just a design act.
*   **Test for Specificity:** If your strategy doc could apply to your competitor, it is too vague.

### Prioritize Destination over Distance
Avoid the "Road Trip Fallacy."
*   **The Fallacy:** Setting a goal of "driving 250 miles" without picking a city.
*   **The Fix:** Pick the destination (Strategy) first. The "250 miles" (Goal) is only meaningful if it brings you closer to that specific destination.

## Examples

**Example 1: Relationship Apps**
*   **Context:** Hinge vs. Tinder.
*   **Mission Difference:** Hinge is "Designed to be deleted"; Tinder is "Make single life fun."
*   **Strategy Impact:** Because Hinge’s mission is long-term relationships, their **Product Strategy** prioritizes detailed profiles and prompts. Because Tinder’s mission is about the fun of being single, their **Product Strategy** prioritizes a lightweight, serendipitous "swipe" mechanic.
*   **Roadmap Outcome:** Hinge builds prompts to spark conversation; Tinder builds features like "Super Like" to increase matching speed.

**Example 2: Marketplace Navigation**
*   **Context:** Tripadvisor trip planning.
*   **Problem:** PMs were optimizing for immediate bookings (Goals) but users kept leaving for Google (Strategy failure).
*   **Application:** The team shifted the **Product Strategy** to "keep users on-site for planning." They added "Save to Trip" buttons to the **Roadmap**, even though it slightly decreased immediate booking conversion, because it served the higher-level strategy of direct retention.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

*   **Goals-First Planning:** Starting with "Increase revenue by 10%" leads to spaghetti-at-the-wall experimentation. Always define the strategic "Why" before the metric.
*   **Vague Strategy:** Using "mushy" language that everyone agrees with but no one can execute. If there is no trade-off (e.g., choosing *not* to build certain filters), it isn't a strategy.
*   **The "Words-Only" Trap:** Assuming a written doc creates alignment. Without a visual conceptual framework (wireframes), team members will have different mental models of the same strategy.
*   **Ignoring the "Frontier of Understanding":** Committing to a specific outcome goal (e.g., "Improve retention") when the team doesn't yet understand what levers move that metric. In these cases, the goal should be "Learning" or "Execution," not just the outcome.
