description: A framework for determining which growth engine—SEO, Paid, or Virality—best fits your product based on unit economics and product mechanics. Use this when planning your initial growth strategy, evaluating why a channel is underperforming, or deciding when to diversify beyond your primary engine.
---

Assess your product's inherent mechanics and unit economics to identify and validate your primary growth engine. Successful growth usually relies on one dominant engine (80% of growth) rather than a highly diversified mix in the early stages.

## Step 1: Identify Your Primary Engine Fit
Evaluate your product against these three archetypes to determine where to focus your resources.

### 1. The Virality & Referral Engine
Focus here if the utility of your product increases as more people use it.
*   **Core Signal:** Inherent product network effects (e.g., collaboration tools like Airtable or Whimsical).
*   **Alternative Signal:** A "beloved brand" with high emotional resonance that supports "give-one-get-one" referrals even without network effects.
*   **The Trap:** Avoid trying to "engineer" virality into a single-player utility (e.g., a grammar checker) where it isn't natural.

### 2. The SEO & Content Engine
Focus here if your product can generate high-volume, high-value pages at scale. Check if you have at least two of the following:
*   **Unique Programmatic Angle:** Can you generate thousands of pages based on templates or use cases? (e.g., Canva's "wedding invitation template" pages).
*   **Unique Data Angle:** Do you have proprietary data that can be turned into valuable organic search experiences? (e.g., personal finance spending patterns).
*   **Unique Editorial Angle:** Do you have a perspective that adds something new to the existing "how-to" landscape?

### 3. The Paid Growth Engine
Focus here if your unit economics allow for aggressive customer acquisition costs (CAC).
*   **Benchmark LTV:** High single-player LTV (hundreds of dollars per year). If your LTV caps at $50-$60, paid acquisition is rarely sustainable.
*   **Benchmark Conversion:** You should convert 5% to 7%+ of free users to paid subscribers. Anything under 5% makes paid growth difficult to sustain long-term.
*   **Strategic Use:** Use paid not just for scale, but for rapid testing of messaging, positioning, and feature demand.

## Step 2: Give the Channel an "Appropriate Shot"
Avoid the "shallow testing" trap where you conclude a channel doesn't work because of poor execution. Before abandoning a channel (like YouTube or Meta), ensure you have:
1.  **Defined Test Guardrails:** Set a minimum number of impressions and a specific timebox (e.g., 3 months for SEO).
2.  **Multiple Creative Angles:** Test at least 2–3 distinct messaging/creative directions before calling the test a failure.
3.  **Benchmark Comparison:** Compare your click-through rates (CTR) and conversion rates against category benchmarks before blaming the channel itself.

## Step 3: Benchmarking Your Performance
Use these heuristics to determine if your funnel is ready for scaling:
*   **Website to Free User:** 20% to 35% conversion rate at scale.
*   **Free to Paid User:** 5% to 7% conversion rate (for prosumer/premium SAS).
*   **Payback Period:** Aim for a 6-month payback in the current market (down from the 12-month historical standard).

## Examples

**Example 1: SEO Strategy Audit**
*   **Context:** A B2B design tool is deciding whether to invest in SEO.
*   **Input:** The tool allows users to create social media headers, resumes, and posters.
*   **Application:** The team applies the "3-Box Framework." They identify a **Unique Programmatic Angle** (creating landing pages for every possible template type: "Twitter Header Template," "Minimalist Resume Template").
*   **Output:** They commit to a 3-month programmatic SEO pilot, generating 500 template-based landing pages to measure indexation and initial traffic.

**Example 2: Paid Channel Validation**
*   **Context:** A prosumer productivity app tried YouTube ads and saw a $200 CAC against a $100 LTV. They are about to quit.
*   **Input:** Review of the "Appropriate Shot" criteria.
*   **Application:** The audit reveals they only used one video creative and targeted a broad interest group. They shift to testing three creative angles (Problem/Solution, Feature Walkthrough, and User Testimonial) and implement "Incrementality Testing" (turning off the channel in specific regions) to measure true causal lift.
*   **Output:** They discover the "User Testimonial" creative brings CAC down to $70, making the channel viable.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Premature Diversification:** Trying to build 3 engines at once. If one engine is providing 80% of growth, optimize the "banana stand" (your existing strength) before distracting the team with new channels.
*   **Under-investing in Onboarding:** Failing to realize that onboarding can often provide a 2x-4x lift in activation, which is more effective than increasing top-of-funnel spend.
*   **The Attribution Ghost:** Cutting channels because you can't "perfectly" attribute them. Use Media Mix Modeling or Incrementality Testing instead of relying solely on click-based cookies.
*   **Series B Tactics at Series A:** Investing in long-term SEO when you only have 8 months of runway. Match the channel’s return horizon to your funding timeline.
