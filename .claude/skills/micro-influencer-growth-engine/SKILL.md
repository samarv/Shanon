# Micro-Influencer Growth Engine

This framework focuses on building a "wildfire" growth effect by partnering with thousands of micro-influencers who hold deep trust within specific niches (e.g., educators, consultants, designers). Unlike celebrity endorsements, this method relies on authentic usage and high-volume experimentation.

## Core Principles

- **The "One Egg" Rule:** If you throw someone one egg, they can catch it. If you throw four, they drop all of them. Give influencers exactly ONE core value proposition to highlight (e.g., "Create a slide deck in seconds").
- **Echo Chambers:** Focus on niches where users talk to each other. One teacher telling other teachers about a tool is more powerful than a generalist creator telling a million random followers.
- **Brand as Infrastructure:** Influencers shouldn't reinvent your look. Provide a "Brand Kit" (art direction, tone of voice, Midjourney prompts) to ensure their content looks high-quality and cohesive.
- **The 90/10 Rule:** Expect 90% of your reach to come from the top 10% of your influencer partners. You cannot predict who they will be; you must cast a wide net.

## The Workflow

### 1. Identify the Niche (The Echo Chamber)
Search for "Micro-Influencers" (10k–50k followers) in categories where your product solves a daily pain point.
- **Example:** For a presentation tool, target educators (who make slides daily) or sales consultants (who pitch daily).

### 2. The "Founder-Led" Onboarding
Before scaling, the founder/CEO must manually onboard the first 20–50 influencers.
- **Jump on a call:** Do not just send a brief.
- **Demo the product:** Ensure they understand the "magic" (the first 30 seconds of value).
- **Listen for their voice:** Ask how *they* would describe it to their audience. Do not force a script.

### 3. Provide the "Open Source" Brand Kit
Give influencers the assets they need to succeed without creative friction.
- **Art Direction:** Provide specific styles or "Vibes."
- **Visual Assets:** Shared folders with high-res logos, screenshots, and video clips.
- **AI Prompts:** If your product uses AI, share the exact prompts used to generate high-quality outputs.

### 4. High-Volume Experimentation
- **Budget:** Start with $10k–$20k per month for at least 6 months.
- **Volume:** Aim for 20–50 creators per month initially, scaling to 100+.
- **Cost:** Pay low single-digit thousands or a few hundred dollars per post.
- **Automation:** Use platforms like **1stCollab** or specialized "young/hungry" agencies (e.g., **AKG Media**) to handle outbound and creator sourcing.

### 5. Measure and Double Down
Track which niches have the highest conversion rates (e.g., LinkedIn usually converts 4x–5x better than other platforms for B2B/Prosumer).
- If "Educators" are converting well, find 100 more educators. 
- If a specific hook (e.g., "The end of PowerPoint") goes viral, make that the core brief for the next month.

## Examples

**Example 1: The Educator Niche**
- **Context:** Target teachers on TikTok/Instagram who share productivity tips for the classroom.
- **Input:** A 30-second screen recording of the tool generating a lesson plan deck.
- **Application:** Influencer shares how they used the tool to save 2 hours of prep time for Monday morning.
- **Output:** High-intent traffic from other teachers looking to save time.

**Example 2: The "Controversial" Hook**
- **Context:** Using LinkedIn creators to spark debate.
- **Input:** A provocative statement: "The most valuable skill in business is about to become obsolete."
- **Application:** Influencer uses the hook to stop the scroll, then demos the product as the "new way" to work.
- **Output:** High engagement, comments from industry leaders, and brand authority.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Scripting too tightly:** If you give a creator a script to read, it feels like an ad. If it feels like an ad, the audience ignores it. Give them the "egg" (the value prop) but let them use their own voice.
- **Starting too small:** Spending $2k on one big influencer and quitting when it doesn't work. It is better to spend $2k on 10 small influencers to see which niche "pops."
- **Investing before Word-of-Mouth:** Do not use influencers to fix a leaky bucket. If your organic retention is bad, influencers will just accelerate people leaving. Ensure your "first 30 seconds" of onboarding are magical first.
- **Ignoring LinkedIn:** Many founders sleep on LinkedIn. While more expensive, the conversion quality for prosumer/B2B tools is often 5x higher than TikTok.
