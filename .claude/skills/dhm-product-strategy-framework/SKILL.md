description: A framework to evaluate product hypotheses by balancing customer delight, competitive advantage (hard-to-copy), and business viability (margin-enhancing). Use it when vetting a major new feature, defining a long-term product roadmap, or deciding whether to kill an existing initiative.

The DHM framework (Delight, Hard-to-copy, Margin-enhancing) shifts product thinking from a list of features to a set of strategic hypotheses. Its goal is to build a product that customers love while creating a sustainable, defensible business.

## The DHM Model

Every product strategy should aim to satisfy these three pillars simultaneously:

1.  **Delight Customers:** Focus on experiences that are 10x better than the status quo, not just incremental improvements.
2.  **Hard-to-copy:** Build "moats" that prevent competitors from easily replicating your success. Key sources include:
    *   **Network Effects:** The product becomes more valuable as more people use it.
    *   **Unique Technology:** Proprietary algorithms or systems (e.g., Netflix’s personalization).
    *   **Brand:** Trust built over time that reduces friction in transactions.
    *   **Economies of Scale:** Lowering costs or increasing value as the user base grows.
3.  **Margin-enhancing:** Features must ultimately contribute to the business model, typically by improving retention or increasing lifetime value (LTV).

## The Strategic Evaluation Process

### 1. Formulate the Hypothesis
State your strategy as a high-level theory. 
*   *Format:* "By building [Feature/Experience], we will delight customers in a [Hard-to-copy] way that improves [Margin Metric]."

### 2. Run the Reach Test
Avoid "Two Percenters"—features that only appeal to a tiny fraction of your audience but add complexity for everyone.
*   Ask: What percentage of our total members will actually use this feature?
*   Threshold: If the reach is under 5-10%, consider "scraping the barnacles" (killing the feature) to maintain simplicity.

### 3. Calculate the Value/Cost Trade-off
Evaluate if the "Delight" (measured in retention) justifies the "Margin" (cost).
*   **Step A:** Estimate the Lifetime Value (LTV) of a saved customer.
*   **Step B:** Apply a "Word of Mouth" multiplier (e.g., 2x) to account for organic growth.
*   **Step C:** Compare the total value of saved customers against the total operational cost of the feature.

## Examples

**Example 1: Perfect New Release (DVD-by-mail)**
*   **Context:** Customers requested faster access to new movie releases.
*   **Hypothesis:** Sending DVDs the next day would delight customers and improve retention.
*   **Application:** An A/B test showed a tiny retention improvement (4.5% to 4.45%).
*   **Math:** Saving 5,000 customers ($100 LTV x 2x multiplier) was worth $1M. However, the inventory cost was $5M.
*   **Decision:** Do not roll out. The cost to the margin outweighed the marginal delight.

**Example 2: Personalization & Recommendations**
*   **Context:** Helping users find movies among thousands of choices.
*   **Delight:** Dramatically reduces the time it takes to find a movie to watch.
*   **Hard-to-copy:** Proprietary algorithms and the massive dataset of user taste profiles.
*   **Margin-enhancing:** Improves retention and allows "right-sizing" content investments (e.g., knowing exactly how many people will watch *Stranger Things* vs. *BoJack Horseman*).
*   **Decision:** Heavily invest. It hits all three DHM pillars.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Solving for "Satisficing" instead of "Delight":** Listening to customer complaints usually leads to incremental fixes. True delight comes from testing 10x better experiences customers haven't asked for yet.
*   **Ignoring the "Hard-to-copy" Pillar:** Launching features that are easy to copy (like a new UI layout) provides only a temporary advantage. If a competitor can copy it in a week, it isn't a strategy; it's a tactic.
*   **Over-complicating for Complexity's Sake:** Adding features that only 2% of people use creates a "stinky" experience and technical debt that slows down the core product.
*   **Valuing Simplicity over Customer Choice:** While simplicity is a virtue, sometimes "Customer Choice" (like an ad-supported tier) is more important for growth than maintaining a perfectly simple subscription model.
