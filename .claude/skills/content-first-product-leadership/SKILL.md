name: content-first-product-leadership
description: A framework for shifting from "process management" to "product creation." Use this when you feel trapped in project management (Jira/Scrum), when launching a 0-to-1 product that requires high vision, or when hiring product leaders who need to "do the work" rather than just manage it.

# Content-First Product Leadership

Product Managers often fail by becoming "process monkeys"—experts at moving tickets and managing meetings but disconnected from the actual product. Content-First Leadership prioritizes the "Content" (what to do and when) over the "Process" (how to do it).

## Core Principles

### 1. Distinguish Content vs. Process
*   **Content:** The core "what" and "why." It is the roadmap, the user insight, the specific feature requirements, and the strategy.
*   **Process:** The "how." It is Scrum, Agile, Jira, and meeting cadences. 
*   **Rule:** Hire for content and teach process. It is nearly impossible to teach a "process person" how to have product intuition (content), but easy to teach a "content person" how to run a sprint.

### 2. Practice Intentionality (The GPS Metaphor)
Never ask the data to tell you where to go.
*   **The Vision:** Like a GPS, you must input the destination first (your "Intentionality").
*   **The A/B Test:** Use testing only to find the fastest/most efficient route to that pre-defined destination.
*   **The Trap:** Avoid "lazy PMing," where you run A/B tests to see *if* you should do something rather than how to do it best.

### 3. Design the "15-out-of-10" Experience
When building a new feature or product, remove all constraints (time, budget, engineering) to find the "ideal" end state.
*   Start by designing the perfect experience (the 15/10).
*   Work backward to a 7/10 or 8/10 "lovable" version.
*   Do not start at a 5/10 and try to optimize your way to a 10.

## Application Guide

### The "Work Challenge" Interview
To identify content-first leaders, move beyond "tell me about a time" questions.
1.  **Assign a real-world problem:** (e.g., "We need to scale our operations to 120 countries without a local presence. How would you do it?")
2.  **Look for depth, not process:** Disregard candidates who answer with "I would set up a brainstorm and create a roadmap." 
3.  **Identify "In-the-Mud" Thinking:** Value candidates who propose specific tactical solutions (e.g., "I would look for third-party logistics partners to white-label the service first").

### The "Lounge" Strategy for 0-to-1
Use this process when launching a physical or complex digital product:
1.  **Pick one location/segment:** Do not try to scale to 100 markets immediately.
2.  **Build the "Unscalable" Best Version:** Hire the best specialists (e.g., a top-tier barista for a lounge) and buy the best equipment.
3.  **Identify "What Worked":** Observe what users love about the high-touch version.
4.  **Automate/Scale only the lovable parts:** Do not scale mediocrity.

## Examples

**Example 1: Setting Product Intentionality**
*   **Context:** A social media team wants to allow users to upload old photos to a "Stories" feature.
*   **Process-Driven Approach:** A/B test "Camera Only" vs. "Camera + Gallery" and see which increases engagement.
*   **Content-First Approach:** Define the intentionality: "Stories should be the world's largest real-time TV channel." Because the goal is *real-time news*, you intentionally disable the gallery upload (even if data suggests it would increase posts) to preserve the product's soul.

**Example 2: Executing the 15-out-of-10 Framework**
*   **Context:** Improving the "early check-in" experience for a travel app.
*   **Constraint-Minded Thinking:** "We don't have enough staff for early check-ins, so let's just add a 'request' button and see what happens."
*   **15/10 Thinking:** "The perfect experience is a host meeting the guest at the airport with the keys." 
*   **Application:** Since you can't scale airport meetings, you build a "digital key" feature that unlocks the door the moment the guest's flight lands—capturing the "magic" of the 15/10 experience in a scalable way.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Process Obsession:** If your calendar is 80% meetings about *how* the team is working rather than *what* they are building, you have lost the content.
*   **Designing by Committee:** Avoid the "least common denominator" decision. Use a **Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)** model where one person listens to all input but makes the final call, regardless of consensus.
*   **A/B Testing for Permission:** Do not use data as a shield against the risk of being wrong. If you have high conviction in a "15/10" vision, ship the baseline and iterate from there rather than testing every minor assumption.
*   **Delegating the "Mud":** Leaders who stop being able to do the work of their subordinates eventually lose the ability to judge the "content" of the roadmap. Stay close enough to the "clay" to help your team shape it.
