# Founder Etiquette and Social Fluency

The goal of professional etiquette is not to follow stuffy rules, but to project self-confidence and build trust. Effective etiquette allows you to show up in any room with a "low heart rate," signaling that you belong and have an abundance mindset rather than a transactional, scarcity-driven one.

## The Core Mindset: Abundance vs. Scarcity

*   **Low Heart Rate:** Approach interactions with calm. If you show up like an "Energizer Bunny" trying too hard to make a sale, you project desperation.
*   **Abundance Mindset:** Treat every interaction as part of a long-term story, not your "one shot." This allows you to give more than you take.
*   **Signaling Effort:** The effort you put into etiquette (arriving early, dressing appropriately) signals respect for the room and the people in it.

## 1. Networking and Introductions

Use these tactics to navigate rooms and meet new people without friction.

*   **The Safety Greeting:** Always use the phrase "Great to see you" instead of "Nice to meet you." If you have met before and forgot, "Nice to meet you" is offensive; "Great to see you" works in all scenarios.
*   **The Partner Save:** If you are with a partner/friend and forget someone's name, introduce your partner first ("Jessica, I want to introduce you..."). This forces the other person to extend their hand and say their name to your partner.
*   **Entering the Room:** Arrive 10–15 minutes early. If you are earlier, walk around the block. Do not sit in a lobby for an hour.
*   **Inclusive Circles:** When talking to a high-profile person, don't waylay or block them. Be inclusive of others standing nearby to show social mastery.

## 2. The "Ping-Pong" Conversation

Treat conversations as a two-player game, not a monologue.

*   **The Give-to-Get Ratio:** For every piece of information you "get" (ask a question), you must "give" (share a thought or story).
*   **Avoid the Inquisition:** Do not ask six questions in a row without offering your own perspective. 
*   **Leave Them Wanting More:** Exit a conversation while it is still good. Do not tell your entire life story.
*   **Graceful Exits:** Use "I’m going to go grab a drink" or "I need to say hi to [Person]" as a standard wind-down. If someone uses these on you, do not follow them to the bar.

## 3. High-Stakes Dining Etiquette

Dining is a primary venue for building trust. Do not let mechanics distract from the conversation.

*   **The B and D Rule:** Hold your hands in front of you and make "b" and "d" shapes with your fingers. Your **B**read plate is on the left; your **D**rink is on the right.
*   **Ordering Logic:** Never order the most expensive thing on the menu. Do not order first; wait for the host to set the tone (e.g., are we doing appetizers?).
*   **The Bill Dance:** Always offer to pay, especially as a junior person or founder. Expect to be turned down by the senior person/VC, but the gesture signals you view the relationship as an equal exchange.
*   **Tipping:** Tip a minimum of 20%. If you are with a very famous or wealthy person and you are paying, you must tip significantly higher (up to 100%) to match their likely social "tax."

## 4. Scheduling and Communication

Etiquette in digital spaces is about respecting the other person's time and hierarchy.

*   **The Calendly Rule:** Do not lead with a Calendly link if you are the one asking for the meeting or are the less senior party. It places the "work" of scheduling on the busier person.
*   **Email Hierarchy:** The order of names in the "To" field matters. Place the most senior/relevant person first. Use the "CC" line for people who need a copy but aren't expected to reply.
*   **Emoji Caution:** Avoid emojis in initial high-stakes business emails. They can signal a lack of professionalism or an over-investment in "customizing" your digital persona rather than doing the work.

## 5. Dress and Presence

*   **One Level Up:** Identify the expected dress code of the room and dress exactly one level above it (e.g., if it's "hoodie casual," wear a nice sweater/button-down).
*   **Fit Over Brand:** A $20 tailored shirt is superior to a $500 shirt that doesn't fit. 
*   **Virtual Presence:** On video calls, keep your camera on. Ensure your background is clean; close your closet doors and make your bed if they are visible.

**Example 1: High-Stakes Event**
*   **Context:** You are at a major industry holiday party with potential investors.
*   **Application:** You approach a target VC. Instead of "Nice to meet you," you say "Great to see you." You ask one insightful question about their recent thesis, share a 30-second "give" regarding a trend you're seeing, and then excuse yourself after 5 minutes to "say hi to a friend," leaving them wanting more.

**Example 2: Scheduling a Pitch**
*   **Context:** A partner at a firm agrees to meet with you.
*   **Application:** You do not send a Calendly link. You write: "I can make any time work on Tuesday or Wednesday to suit your schedule. Alternatively, I'm happy to use your scheduling link if you have one." This honors their time and demonstrates a low-friction approach.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **The Monopoly:** Dominating the conversation with a 10-minute "startup spiel." Etiquette is about the exchange, not the pitch.
*   **Missing the Gatekeeper:** Being dismissive of EAs or PAs. Disrespecting the "staff" is the fastest way to signal you lack class and professional maturity.
*   **The "One Shot" Panic:** Acting like this meeting is your only chance for success. This raises your heart rate and makes you a social "Energizer Bunny," which is exhausting for the other person.
*   **Overstaying the Welcome:** Not recognizing the "modem crash" of small talk is over and it's time to get to business, or not recognizing when a meeting has naturally concluded.
