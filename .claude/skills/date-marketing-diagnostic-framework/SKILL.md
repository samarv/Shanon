description: A four-step diagnostic framework to identify specific growth bottlenecks and develop a differentiated market strategy. Use this when your current marketing "playbook" isn't driving revenue, when preparing for a new product launch, or when choosing which marketing lead (brand, demand gen, or product marketing) to hire first.
---

The DATE framework moves teams away from "copy-paste" marketing playbooks and toward a diagnostician's approach. Instead of applying generic tactics, use this process to identify exactly where your funnel is broken and how to "zig" where competitors "zag."

## The DATE Framework

### 1. Diagnose the Actual Problem
Before hiring or spending, audit your funnel to identify the specific bottleneck.
*   **Top of Funnel (Awareness):** Do people know you exist? (e.g., OpenAI had high awareness but low "use case epiphany").
*   **Middle of Funnel (Consideration):** Once in the room, are they asking "How do you compare to X?" or "Why does this cost so much?" This indicates a product-marketing or positioning problem, not a lead-gen problem.
*   **Bottom of Funnel (Conversion):** Are you winning the deals you start? If yes, throw fuel on the fire with demand gen. If no, you have a leaky funnel that more leads won't fix.

### 2. Analyze Competitors' Approaches
Evaluate what others in your space are doing—not to copy them, but to identify the "sea of sameness."
*   Map out their primary channels (e.g., Are they all doing heavy SEO? Are they all at the same conferences?).
*   Identify their jargon. Are they all using the same industry buzzwords?
*   Look for the gaps. What are they *not* talking about that customers actually care about?

### 3. Take a Different Path
Intentionally drive a strategy that sets you apart. Use cross-domain inspiration (look at industries far outside your own) to find fresh tactics.
*   **Zig when others zag:** If competitors use old-school jargon, use plain language. If they rely on paid social, double down on customer storytelling.
*   **Avoid the "Better/Cheaper" trap:** Being cheaper is a race to the bottom. Aim for "Different" or "Niche" instead.

### 4. Experiment, Test, and Validate
Run small-scale tests to see if your "different path" actually converts.
*   Set clear KPIs (Revenue/Pipeline, not just clicks/impressions).
*   **Kill your darlings:** If a piece of content or a channel isn't working, discard it immediately regardless of how many "calories" you spent creating it.
*   Scale only what shows a substantive impact on the bottom of the funnel.

## Internal Process: The Marketing Review
To ensure consistency and quality without slowing down, implement these two checkpoints:

*   **20% Review (Strategy):** Align on the "Who," "What," and "Why." Is the approach sound?
*   **80% Review (Artifacts):** Review the nearly-finished product. This is late enough to see the polish but early enough to make substantive changes. Do not wait for the "99% mark" where the reviewer's input is just a rubber stamp.

## Examples

**Example 1: Retool's Awareness Strategy**
*   **Diagnosis:** Retool had high product-market fit but low awareness.
*   **Analysis:** Competitors were scaling paid social and generic content.
*   **Different Path:** Retool doubled down on "Customer Storytelling." They leveraged their high-tier enterprise logos (like Netflix) to tell the story for them, as copycat competitors couldn't replicate that social proof.
*   **Outcome:** Switched budget from underperforming paid social to high-conversion webinars and sales dinners.

**Example 2: Stripe Connect's "Reverse RFP"**
*   **Diagnosis:** Customers were trying to decide between using Stripe or becoming their own "Payment Facilitator" (PayFac).
*   **Analysis:** PayFac consultants used heavy legacy jargon and SEO to capture intent.
*   **Different Path:** Stripe created a "Secret Playbook" for becoming a PayFac. It ranked for all the same SEO terms but honestly detailed how onerous and annoying the process was, naturally positioning Stripe Connect as the logical alternative.
*   **Outcome:** Captured high-intent search traffic and converted it to Connect users without pretending to be a consulting service.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Optimizing for "Bullshit Numbers":** Clicks, views, and impressions are vanity metrics. Focus exclusively on signups, sales-qualified opportunities, and revenue.
*   **The Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Doubling down on a marketing channel just because you hired a team for it or spent months on the creative. If it doesn't drive pipeline, kill it.
*   **The "Handoff" Mentality:** Treating marketing as the end of a conveyor belt. Marketing and PM should be a "three-legged race" from the start of product development.
*   **Waiting for 99% to Review:** Seeking approval when it's too late to change anything makes the review process a waste of time and prevents organizational learning.
