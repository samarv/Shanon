# Startup Marketing Hiring Framework

The "Fuel and Engine" framework moves away from confusing sub-functional titles (like demand gen vs. growth) and focuses on the actual constraints of the business. By identifying whether you lack "Fuel" (content and messaging) or an "Engine" (distribution and ops), you can hire a "Pie-Shaped" marketer who fills your specific gaps while maintaining strategic breadth.

## Phase 1: The Fuel vs. Engine Diagnostic
Before writing a job description, identify your primary growth bottleneck.

### 1. Identify the Constraint
*   **The Fuel:** This is the "what." It includes the copy on the website, blog posts, sales decks, calculators, templates, and the core positioning.
    *   *Symptoms of a Fuel Problem:* You have channels set up but nothing interesting to say; your outbound emails have low response rates because the value prop is weak; your website looks generic.
*   **The Engine:** This is the "how." It includes distribution channels, email automation rules, SEO technical setup, paid ad management, and marketing ops (HubSpot/CDP).
    *   *Symptoms of an Engine Problem:* You have amazing content that no one sees; your website has high traffic but 0% conversion; your sales handoff is a manual mess of spreadsheets.

### 2. Match to Business Model
*   **Top-Down Sales:** Usually requires **Fuel** first. Sales teams need the story, decks, and content to enable their outbound "engine."
*   **Product-Led Growth (PLG):** Usually requires **Engine** first. You need to optimize the "marketing-to-product handoff," focusing on conversion, onboarding flows, and lifecycle triggers.

## Phase 2: Search for "Pie-Shaped" Marketers
Avoid hiring specialists (who are too narrow) or "big company" executives (who lack "scrappiness"). Instead, hire a **Pie-Shaped Marketer** (represented by the symbol $\pi$).

### The Three Pillars
A startup marketer should be evaluated across three spikes:
1.  **Product Marketing:** Positioning, messaging, audience research, and launches.
2.  **Content & Community:** Long-form writing, social media, and brand storytelling.
3.  **Growth & Demand Gen:** Data-driven distribution, ads, SEO, and funnel optimization.

### The Pie-Shaped Profile
The ideal first hire is:
*   **Expert in One Pillar:** Deep technical execution.
*   **Proficient in a Second Pillar:** Can execute without heavy oversight.
*   **Strategic in All Three:** Can set the roadmap and manage contractors for the third pillar.

*Note: It is extremely rare to find someone expert in both Content and Growth (Data). Most "Pie" profiles are [Product Marketing + Growth] or [Product Marketing + Content].*

## Phase 3: The Interview & Vetting Process
Use these specific screens to differentiate "Impact-Focused" marketers from "Activity-Focused" marketers.

### The Positioning Test
Ask the candidate to describe their current company:
1.  What is the product?
2.  Who is it for?
3.  Why is it better than competitors?
*Red Flag: If they cannot answer these simply, they cannot do it for your startup.*

### The Impact Screen
Review their past projects and look for the transition from tactics to goals.
*   **Activity Focus (Bad):** "My goal was to write 10 blog posts a month."
*   **Impact Focus (Good):** "My goal was to increase organic sign-ups by 20% by using content as a magnet, maintaining a specific conversion-to-active-user rate."

### The Seniority Trap
Avoid candidates who have only worked at "Scale-up" or Public companies (e.g., Salesforce, Google).
*   **The Reason:** They are used to an established brand and built-in distribution. 
*   **What to look for instead:** Someone who has seen "what great looks like" at a successful company but has also spent time in the "messy middle" where they had to build the foundation themselves.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Hiring by Industry instead of Model:** Prioritize someone who understands your business model (PLG vs. Enterprise) over someone who understands your specific niche (e.g., HR-tech). Great marketers learn audiences quickly; they rarely learn new business motions quickly.
*   **Ignoring the Marketing-to-Product Handoff:** In PLG, don't let the "Signup" button be a wall. Ensure the marketer is looking at conversion rates *inside* the product, not just top-of-funnel leads.
*   **The "Splatergy" Mistake:** Beware of marketers who throw many tactics at the wall without "Big Bets." They should be able to name 2-3 core initiatives they believe will cause a step-change in growth, rather than just "keeping the lights on."

## Examples

**Example 1: Seed-stage PLG Developer Tool**
*   **Context:** High organic traffic to a documentation site, but very few people actually sign up for the cloud version.
*   **Diagnostic:** Engine problem (Conversion/Onboarding).
*   **Target Hire:** A Pie-Shaped marketer with a spike in **Growth** and proficiency in **Product Marketing**. They need to own the website-to-product flow and lifecycle emails.
*   **Output:** A redesigned signup flow and a 5-part "Getting Started" email sequence triggered by API activity.

**Example 2: Series A Enterprise Fintech**
*   **Context:** Five sales reps are struggling because prospects don't understand how the tool differs from Excel. No marketing materials exist.
*   **Diagnostic:** Fuel problem (Positioning/Enablement).
*   **Target Hire:** A Pie-Shaped marketer with a spike in **Product Marketing** and proficiency in **Content**.
*   **Output:** A clear "Why Us" deck, a comparative whitepaper, and three customer case studies used to arm the sales team.---
