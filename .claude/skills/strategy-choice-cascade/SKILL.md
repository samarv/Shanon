description: A framework for defining a strategy through five integrated choices. Use it when launching a new product, facing a competitive threat, or when current performance falls short of goals.

Strategy is an integrated set of choices that uniquely positions a firm in its industry so as to create sustainable advantage and superior value. It is a problem-solving tool used to close the "gap" between current outcomes and desired aspirations.

## The Strategy Choice Cascade

To create a strategy, you must answer these five questions in order, ensuring that each answer reinforces the others. Strategy is iterative; you may need to move back and forth between questions as you refine your logic.

### 1. What is our winning aspiration?
Define the purpose of your enterprise and its motivating aspirations. 
- **Avoid "playing to play":** Don't just exist in a market because it is big. 
- **Focus on the customer:** Frame the aspiration in terms of the value you provide to users (e.g., "To satisfy core customers who find our current tools too narrow for team collaboration").

### 2. Where will we play?
Identify the specific playing field where you will compete. Define this across several dimensions:
- **Geography:** Which regions?
- **Product Category:** What specific product/service?
- **Customer Segment:** Who specifically are we targeting (e.g., "Product Managers and Engineers" vs. "all business users")?
- **Vertical Stage:** Where in the value chain will you sit? (e.g., Are you the manufacturer, the distributor, or the service provider?)
- **Channels:** How will you reach them (e.g., self-serve digital, retail, direct sales)?

### 3. How will we win?
Define the "moat" or the theory of why customers will choose you over competitors. You must choose one of two paths:
- **Differentiation:** Customers perceive your offering as uniquely valuable and are willing to pay a premium or show intense loyalty (e.g., Lego, Apple).
- **Low Cost:** You have a lower cost structure than any competitor, allowing you to offer the lowest prices while remaining profitable (e.g., Vanguard, Southwest Airlines).
- **The "Stuck in the Middle" Trap:** If you aren't clearly differentiated or the low-cost leader, you are vulnerable to "bullies" who can move your market share at will.

### 4. What capabilities must be in place?
Identify the activities and skills required to deliver your "How to Win" choice.
- These are not just generic strengths; they are specific "must-haves."
- Example: If you win through legal search accuracy (Westlaw), your capability is a massive, proprietary system of lawyers tagging every case with unique metadata that competitors cannot easily replicate.

### 5. What management systems are required?
Define the processes, structures, and metrics that build and protect your capabilities.
- Example: If your capability is "superior customer service," your management system must include unique hiring profiles, specific training programs, and incentive structures that reward long-term employee retention.

## The "Betterment" Exercise

If the full cascade feels overwhelming, start with "Betterment":
1. **Identify the Gap:** Find the single most painful gap between your current results and your desired outcomes.
2. **Diagnose the Cascade:** Ask which of the five questions is currently answered poorly.
3. **Adjust and Iterate:** Make a different choice at that level and see if it closes the gap.
4. **Repeat:** Strategy is a practice of constant refinement, not a one-time "perfection" event.

## Examples

**Example 1: Luxury Hotels**
- **Winning Aspiration:** To make high-end business travelers feel "at home" so they can be productive.
- **Where to Play:** Luxury segment, but getting out of real estate ownership to focus 100% on management.
- **How to Win:** Differentiated service that anticipates needs rather than following a rigid rulebook.
- **Must-have Capabilities:** A workforce with extremely low turnover and high autonomy.
- **Management Systems:** Intense 7-stage hiring processes and career development paths that result in 10% turnover in an industry where 80% is the norm.

**Example 2: Financial Services**
- **Winning Aspiration:** To provide the most value to long-term investors.
- **Where to Play:** Broad market index funds for individual and institutional investors.
- **How to Win:** Absolute low-cost leadership.
- **Must-have Capabilities:** Massive scale and a unique ownership structure (owned by the funds themselves).
- **Management Systems:** Ruthless operational efficiency and low-fee structures that prevent competitors from matching price without losing money.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Goal-Setting as Strategy:** Listing "increase revenue by 20%" is an aspiration, not a strategy. A strategy explains *how* you will reach that goal through specific choices.
- **The "Big Market" Fallacy:** Entering a market just because it is large (e.g., "China is a huge market, we should be there") is a recipe for failure. You must have a reason why you will *win* in that market.
- **Ignoring the "Can't/Won't" Test:** A good "How to Win" involves doing things your competitors *can't* do (lack of capability) or *won't* do (because it would hurt their existing business model).
- **Siloing Strategy at the Top:** Believing only the CEO does strategy. Effective strategy requires choices at every level of the organization, down to individual brand managers and product leads.
