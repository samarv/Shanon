description: A set of rituals and mental models to prevent teams from getting bogged down in incremental work. Use this when your roadmap feels purely reactive, when you need to unlock 10x-100x growth opportunities, or when planning the next fiscal year/quarter.

Innovation often stalls because teams lack the explicit "permission to think" or are paralyzed by a fear of failure. This framework provides specific mechanisms to bake high-variance, big-thinking bets into the standard operating rhythm of a product organization.

## 1. The Annual "Crazy Ideas" Ritual
Establish a low-stakes, high-reward channel for radical ideas that don't fit into standard roadmaps.

*   **The Prompt:** Create a company-wide document titled "Crazy Ideas." Define these as ideas that have a 90% chance of making no sense, but a 10% chance of making a 10x to 100x difference to the business.
*   **The Format:** Keep it unstructured. Allow bullet points, demos, or brief memos.
*   **The Follow-up:** Review the previous year’s doc during annual planning. Aim to fund and execute 3-8 items from the list.
*   **The Funding Model:** Treat these as internal startups. Assign 1-2 people (e.g., one engineer and one designer) for the first six months. Do not scale the team until they prove ROI in engagement or revenue.

## 2. The "20% Think Bigger" Planning Filter
Force teams to look beyond their current resource constraints during every planning cycle.

*   **The Charter Addition:** Add a mandatory "Think Bigger" section at the bottom of every team charter or planning document.
*   **The Key Questions:**
    *   "If you had 20% more time/resources, what would you do that isn’t already on this roadmap?"
    *   "If we doubled your team size today, what would you change about our strategy?"
*   **The Goal:** Surface high-impact opportunities that are being suppressed by "treading water" with technical debt or urgent bugs.

## 3. The "Scooter" Implementation Model
When building new products or big bets, avoid the "axle" trap. If you are building toward a "car," don't build non-functional parts (the axle) first. Build the "scooter"—the simplest functional version that allows a user to complete a value-added task.

*   **Vertical Slicing:** Instead of building a general-purpose platform, build a specific slice for a niche use case.
*   **Example Application:** If building a mobile app platform, don't build a general builder first. Build a specific tool for "Field Workers doing Inventory Management."

## 4. Guidelines for Protecting Innovation
*   **Build for the Best User:** Do not design early-stage products around abuse cases or "worst-user" behaviors. Focus entirely on the user who "gets it" immediately. Optimize for the "best user" first; deal with abuse only when the scale makes it a "good problem to have."
*   **Isolate New Bets:** Keep innovation teams separate from core product teams early on. Do not let them get bogged down in the maintenance, bugs, or standard processes of a product that already has Product-Market Fit.
*   **Normalize Failure through Public Learning:** Replace "Post-mortems" with "Retrospectives." When a big bet fails, have the team write a "Learnings Note" and share it via company-wide channels (e.g., a "Shipped" email list or All-Hands) to celebrate the insight gained rather than the outcome.

## Examples

**Example 1: Expanding Product Scope**
*   **Context:** A team is focused on building a front-end UI builder.
*   **Input:** The "Crazy Ideas" doc suggests users need to run scheduled tasks, but it doesn't fit the "UI builder" identity.
*   **Application:** Fund a "Two-Person Startup" (1 PM, 1 Eng) to build a "scooter" version of a workflow engine.
*   **Output:** The launch of a "Workflows" product that expands the company's TAM from UI building to full business logic.

**Example 2: Planning with the "Think Bigger" Filter**
*   **Context:** A team is 100% booked with "Urgent" tech debt and bug fixes for the next quarter.
*   **Input:** The "20% more time" question reveals the team has a vision for an AI-driven automation feature but didn't think it was "allowed."
*   **Application:** The Lead identifies the vision, re-prioritizes 20% of the tech debt to the following quarter, and gives the team permission to prototype the AI feature.
*   **Output:** A high-impact demo that secures permanent funding for an "AI Automation" pillar.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **The "Process Average" Trap:** Applying the same heavy templates and review cycles to "Crazy Ideas" as you do to core products. This brings high performers down to the average and kills creativity.
*   **Over-Engineering the MVP:** Building the "axle" (the complex backend for a 3-year vision) instead of the "scooter" (a functional tool for a 3-week test).
*   **Worrying about Abuse Too Early:** Adding friction to onboarding to prevent "bad users" before you've even proven "best users" want the product.
*   **Lack of Air Cover:** Failing to "break the org" for a high-performer. Some innovators need to be exempt from standard processes to do their best work; managers must provide the air cover for this.
