description: A framework for proactively managing your relationship with leadership by providing high-signal updates, eliminating surprises, and forcing alignment on trade-offs. Use this when you need to increase trust with your manager, align on changing priorities, or handle high-stakes stakeholder requests.

Managing up is the act of taking responsibility for your manager’s context so they can support you effectively. By providing high-signal communication and forcing alignment on trade-offs, you transition from being "managed" to being a trusted partner who protects the team's bandwidth.

## The "State of You" Weekly Update
Send a weekly, structured update (e.g., "The State of [Your Name]") to your manager. This eliminates the need for them to pepper you with status questions and ensures you are aligned on what matters most.

### The 3-Part Structure
1.  **Blockers:** Any items where you are stuck and need their specific authority or input to move forward.
2.  **Priorities:** The top 3–5 items you are focused on this week.
3.  **On My Mind:** High-level reflections, early-stage risks, or cultural observations that aren't yet "tasks" but require visibility.

## High-Signal Formatting: BLUF + Context
Avoid "cognitive load" by separating your conclusions from your background data. Use the **Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)** method for all Slack messages and emails.

*   **The Lead:** Start with the decision made or the specific action required.
*   **The Recommendation:** If you are presenting a choice, state your preferred path clearly. Do not use "leading" questions that hide your opinion; be direct.
*   **Context Section:** Use a "Context:" header below the lead. Provide the rationale, data, and "why" for those who want to dig deeper.
*   **Risks:** Explicitly list what could go wrong. This builds trust by showing you aren't "selling" an idea but evaluating it rigorously.

## Saying "No" via Trade-offs
When a manager or stakeholder adds a new task to your plate, do not give a hard "No" or a silent "Yes." Instead, use the **Prioritize and Communicate** framework.

**The Script:** 
"I can certainly take that on. To make room for this, I will need to move [Project X] to next week or deprioritize [Task Y]. Does that trade-off align with your current priorities?"

This approach:
*   Puts the requester in control of the prioritization.
*   Forces a conscious decision about bandwidth.
*   Frames you as a team player focused on the most important work.

## Examples

**Example 1: Weekly Status Update**
*   **Context:** A Senior PM reporting to a VP of Product.
*   **Input:** Multiple mid-sprint changes and a blocker on a legal review.
*   **Application:**
    *   **Blockers:** Need your nudge on the Legal team for the privacy doc—it's holding up the beta.
    *   **Priorities:** 1. Finalizing the onboarding flow; 2. Interviewing 3 users for the Search redesign; 3. Cleaning up the Jira backlog.
    *   **On My Mind:** Concerned that the recent churn in the Sales team might impact our Q3 feedback loop.
*   **Output:** The VP knows exactly where to help (Legal) and what is being worked on, requiring zero follow-up.

**Example 2: Handling a Surprise Request**
*   **Context:** A CEO DMs a PM asking for a "quick" new dashboard.
*   **Input:** The PM is currently in the middle of a high-priority launch.
*   **Application:** "I can get that dashboard built. However, doing so today means I'll have to delay the final QA on the Checkout launch by 24 hours. Given the launch is our top goal, would you prefer I prioritize the dashboard now or handle it on Friday?"
*   **Output:** The CEO likely realizes the "quick" request isn't worth delaying the launch, and the PM's bandwidth is protected.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **The "Surprise" Drop:** Sharing bad news (delays, bugs, or missed targets) for the first time in a big meeting. **Rule:** Unless it's a snack or a gift, never surprise your manager.
*   **Interspersing Action Items:** Mixing your requests for help inside long paragraphs of context. The manager will miss the "ask." Always pull action items to the top.
*   **Assuming Seniority Ends the Need:** Thinking that VPs or Directors don't need to manage up. The more senior you are, the more vital it is to manage the context of those above you.
*   **Hidden Opinions:** Providing a "pros and cons" list that is clearly biased toward one side. This makes managers suspicious. State your recommendation upfront and provide an objective view of the risks.
