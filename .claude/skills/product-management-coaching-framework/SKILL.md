# Product Management Coaching Framework

Effective product leadership shifts the focus from "doing the product work" to "developing the people who do the product work." This framework provides a structured approach to move PMs from their current skill level to their "next bigger challenge" through consistent, small-scale interventions rather than high-intensity, infrequent reviews.

## The Five-Step Coaching Workflow

### 1. Define "Good" (The Compass)
Create a clear definition of what a competent PM looks like in your specific company context. Avoid generic lists; focus on the specific needs of your product and team. Use the **PMwheel** buckets to categorize skills:
*   **Problem Understanding:** Grasping underlying user and business problems.
*   **Solution Finding:** Designing effective ways to solve those problems.
*   **Planning:** Roadmapping and goal setting (e.g., OKRs).
*   **Execution (Get it Done):** Working with engineering, writing backlog items, delivery.
*   **Listen & Learn:** Quantitative/qualitative data analysis and iteration.
*   **Team:** Motivation, collaboration, and cross-functional leadership.
*   **Personal Growth:** Curiosity and self-improvement habits.
*   **Agile:** Understanding underlying values and principles of iterative delivery.

### 2. Assess the Current State
"Put a pin on the map" to determine where the PM currently stands against your definition of good.
*   Perform a self-assessment (PM) and a manager assessment (Lead).
*   Compare results to identify gaps in perception.
*   Identify the **Next Bigger Challenge**: What specific project or responsibility would this person be assigned to next if they were ready?

### 3. Create a Shared Vision
Align on the future state. Discuss the "Next Bigger Challenge" with the PM to ensure they share the same ambition. This vision should look beyond their current role at the company to their long-term career trajectory.

### 4. Build the Development Plan
The PM must own this plan, but the leader provides the inspiration. 
*   Select 3–5 themes for the next 6 months.
*   Define concrete actions (e.g., "Read *Continuous Discovery Habits*", "Lead three stakeholder interviews solo", "Present the roadmap to the C-suite").
*   Ensure the plan addresses **personality traits** (like curiosity or empathy) as well as hard skills.

### 5. Establish the Follow-Up Cadence
Consistency beats intensity. Use "micro-coaching" to keep development top-of-mind.
*   **Weekly/Daily:** Provide small "nudges" at the water cooler or via Slack.
*   **Monthly:** Conduct a dedicated coaching session (separate from tactical 1:1s) to color-code progress on the development plan.
*   **Quarterly:** Refresh the development plan with a new headline or focus area.

## Coaching Question Bank
Use these questions during 1:1s to trigger reflection when you haven't prepared a formal agenda:
*   "What would make you more successful in the role you currently have?"
*   "On a scale of 1–10, how do you feel about [Skill X]? What would it take to make that a [Skill X + 1]?"
*   "What is the one thing I could do to improve your situation this week?"
*   "Looking at this list of 30 emotions, which one describes your current state regarding this project, and why?"

## Examples

**Example 1: Transitioning from Execution to Strategy**
*   **Context:** A PM is great at shipping features but struggles to explain *why* they are building them.
*   **Input:** PMwheel assessment shows high "Get it Done" scores but low "Problem Understanding" scores.
*   **Application:** The manager defines the "Next Bigger Challenge" as "Leading the H2 Strategy Planning." They agree on a development plan where the PM will write three "Problem Briefs" before any discovery begins.
*   **Output:** The PM shifts from a "backlog manager" to a "strategic thinker" through guided practice.

**Example 2: Improving Stakeholder Management**
*   **Context:** A PM is receiving feedback that stakeholders feel out of the loop.
*   **Input:** The monthly coaching check-in reveals the PM is avoiding difficult conversations.
*   **Application:** The manager uses the coaching question: "What would make you more comfortable sharing 'bad news' with the Sales team?" They role-play a difficult conversation during the 1:1.
*   **Output:** The PM develops a weekly stakeholder update template and practices radical transparency.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **The "Big Bang" Review:** Waiting for the 6-month performance review to give feedback. Instead, use monthly coaching sessions to ensure there are no surprises.
*   **Manager-Owned Plans:** Creating the development plan *for* the PM. If they don't own the document, they won't own the growth.
*   **Paralysis by Analysis:** Trying to create the "perfect" company-wide career ladder before starting. Start with your own team's "compass" and harmonize with HR later.
*   **Tactical Takeover:** Letting the 1:1 be consumed by "status updates" on projects. Carve out dedicated time where the *PM's growth* is the only product on the table.
