description: A framework for identifying high-margin, low-competition business ideas ("fishing holes") by leveraging personal unfair advantages and avoiding overcrowded markets. Use this when vetting a new startup idea, choosing a niche for a service business, or seeking to pivot an existing product into a more profitable segment.
---

This framework is based on the "Fish where the fish are" philosophy. It prioritizes "boring" but profitable niches over "flashy" markets where competition erodes margins. Use this to find business models that are "hard to mess up" rather than those held together by "dental floss and duct tape."

## 1. Map Your Unfair Advantage (The Venn Diagram)
Identify the intersection of your unique skills and life experiences to find where you have a "head start" over others.

*   **List your Technical/Hard Skills:** (e.g., coding, design, bookkeeping).
*   **List your Soft Skills/Superpowers:** (e.g., "being a talker," sales, organization).
*   **List your Deep Interests/Obsessions:** (e.g., movies, coffee, pressure washing, medical records).
*   **Find the Overlap:** Look for a business idea that requires exactly that combination.
    *   *Example:* If you understand cryptography and economics, you build Coinbase. If you understand design and sales, you build a high-end agency like Metalab.

## 2. Apply the "Fishing Hole" Filter
Evaluate your potential market by looking at the competition density.

*   **Avoid the "Overfished" Ponds:** These are businesses everyone *wants* to start because they seem "cool" (e.g., cafes, restaurants, designer furniture, social apps). High competition leads to low margins and "miserable" operations.
*   **Seek the "Boring" Fishing Holes:** Look for unglamorous problems that people pay significant money to solve (e.g., funeral homes, pest control, grease trap cleaning, government form-filling software).
*   **Look for "Dead Bodies":** Research if others have repeatedly failed in this specific niche. If the business model itself is flawed (like local news or low-margin bars), even a brilliant management team cannot save it.

## 3. Identify the "Value of the Prompt"
Before committing, use AI (Claude, ChatGPT, or Perplexity) to stress-test the economics of the niche.

*   **Run the Unit Economics:** Ask: "Break down the numbers for a [Business Type]. What is the regulatory moat? What does the payroll look like? What are the top 5 failure points?"
*   **Evaluate Pricing Power:** Focus on customers who have large budgets and where your solution solves a high-value problem.
    *   *Poor Niche:* Social media management for local restaurants ($1,000/mo, high demand for time).
    *   *Great Niche:* Social media management for wealth managers ($5,000/mo, high marketing budgets, one lead equals $20k+ for them).

## 4. Design for "Lazy Leadership" (The Scalability Test)
Assess whether the idea will become a "job" you hate or a "business" that runs without you.

*   **The "Teflon for Tasks" Test:** Can you quickly delegate the parts of the business you hate?
*   **The Scale Check:** If the business stays small, is it just a job? (e.g., a one-person pressure washing setup). If it scales, can you step back? (e.g., a pressure washing business with 10 leads/day and hired crews).
*   **The Moat Verification:** Look for at least one of these three competitive advantages:
    1.  **Brand:** High loyal customer recognition and pricing power.
    2.  **Network Effects:** Every new user makes the product more valuable for everyone else (e.g., Letterboxd).
    3.  **High Switching Costs:** It is too painful/expensive for a customer to leave (e.g., ERP software).

## Examples

**Example 1: The Service Pivot**
*   **Context:** A student doing social media marketing for local cafes.
*   **Input:** "I'm working 40 hours for $1k a month and the owners are stressed and demanding."
*   **Application:** Identify a "boring" niche with higher margins (Wealth Managers). Use the same skill set but target clients where a single lead is worth $50k.
*   **Output:** A $5k/mo retainer with 80% less "customer noise."

**Example 2: The Software Niche**
*   **Context:** A developer wants to build a new task manager.
*   **Input:** "I want to compete with Asana/Todoist."
*   **Application:** Recognize that task management is "overfished" by VC-backed giants (the "trawlers"). Pivot to a boring administrative problem.
*   **Output:** Form-filling software for people seeking specific government grants. High "boring" factor, zero VC competition, high willingness to pay.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Deadlifting 300 lbs on Day One:** Trying to start a highly regulated, complex business (like a bank or a major AI company) as a first-time founder. Start with "baby weights" (service businesses) to build a winning narrative.
*   **Hiring for Potential, Not Utility:** Hiring someone you "like" and trying to mentor them into a role. Instead, hire "fully formed" experts who already know how to do the specific task you need.
*   **Being the "Elephant Rider":** Trying to force a CEO or manager to do something against their nature. (e.g., forcing an enterprise sales expert to do organic TikTok marketing). They will always "go where they want to go."
*   **Ignoring the "Loop":** Assuming money will fix your internal anxiety. If you are anxious at $20M in revenue, you will likely be just as anxious at $300M. Address mental health and "executive function" (ADHD/Anxiety) alongside business growth.
