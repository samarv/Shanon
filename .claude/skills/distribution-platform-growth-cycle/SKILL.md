name: distribution-platform-growth-cycle
description: A framework for identifying and capitalizing on new distribution channels (like AI agents or ChatGPT) before they saturate. Use this when launching a new product, when existing channels (SEO, Paid) show declining returns, or when a major technology shift creates new "platforms" where users spend time.

# Distribution Platform Growth Cycle

Building a great product is necessary but insufficient; winning requires achieving "escape velocity" through distribution before incumbents can copy your features. This skill uses a four-step framework to identify emerging distribution platforms and execute a betting strategy to capture early, high-velocity growth.

## The 4-Stage Platform Cycle

Distribution platforms (Facebook, Google, iOS, and now AI Agents) follow a predictable lifecycle. You must identify which stage a platform is in to determine your level of investment.

### Stage 0: Market Consensus & Competition
*   **Definition:** Multiple major players (5–7) are battling for a new category. There is consensus that the category is huge, but no clear winner.
*   **Current Example:** LLMs (OpenAI vs. Anthropic vs. Google vs. Meta).
*   **Action:** Monitor retention and engagement metrics (not just total users/MAU) to predict the winner.

### Stage 1: The Moat Identification
*   **Definition:** A player identifies their defensibility mechanism (e.g., Facebook’s friend graph, ChatGPT’s context/memory).
*   **Action:** Look for the platform that has the highest "smile curve" retention (users returning more over time).

### Stage 2: The Platform Opening (The Opportunity Window)
*   **Definition:** The platform realizes it cannot build every use case alone. It opens a third-party ecosystem (APIs, Store, Agent modes).
*   **Value Exchange:** The platform gives you **distribution** (access to their users); you give them **engagement and utility** (making their platform stickier).
*   **Action:** This is the "Gold Rush" phase. Integrate early to capture low-cost organic traffic.

### Stage 3: The Platform Closing
*   **Definition:** The platform prioritizes monetization and control. It suppresses organic reach to sell ads or launches "first-party" features that compete with top-performing third-party apps.
*   **Action:** Execute your "Exit Strategy" to move users off the platform or build a moat that the platform cannot easily replicate.

## Execution Strategy

### 1. Evaluate the Platform
Choose where to place your "chips" based on these four criteria:
*   **Retention over Scale:** Prioritize platforms with high depth of engagement and retention over those with high vanity metrics (MAUs).
*   **User Quality:** Assess the monetization potential. (e.g., iOS users historically spend significantly more than Android users).
*   **Arbitrage Potential:** Analyze the rules. What is the platform "giving away" for free to grow? (e.g., search attribution, notification channels, or memory access).
*   **Scale and Momentum:** If retention is equal, choose the player with a 10x lead in active usage.

### 2. Set Your Betting Strategy
*   **For Early-Stage Startups:** You cannot spread your resources. Choose **one** emerging platform (e.g., ChatGPT) and go all-in to hit escape velocity.
*   **For Late-Stage Companies:** Place multiple "hedging" bets across platforms to avoid disruption, then double down once a winner emerges.

### 3. Build the Exit Plan
As soon as you enter the game, plan your move to Stage 3:
*   **Own the Workflow:** Move the user's primary "job-to-be-done" into your own interface.
*   **Specialized Data:** Accumulate proprietary context that the horizontal platform doesn't have.
*   **Micro-Network Effects:** Create value between your users that exists independently of the host platform.

## Examples

**Example 1: AI Agent Strategy**
*   **Context:** A B2B CRM startup wants to disrupt an incumbent like Salesforce.
*   **Application:** Instead of fighting for SEO, they build a deep integration for ChatGPT’s "Agent Mode." 
*   **Input:** They expose their data via a specialized MCP (Model Context Protocol).
*   **Output:** They capture users who are transitioning their "search and work" habits to chat interfaces, gaining distribution before the incumbent can adapt its legacy UI.

**Example 2: Niche Platform Play**
*   **Context:** A developer productivity tool.
*   **Application:** They identify that "Cursor" has higher developer retention than VS Code for specific AI workflows.
*   **Input:** They build a plugin specifically for Cursor’s unique context-handling.
*   **Output:** They capture a high-quality, high-intent niche audience that is early in the adoption curve.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **The "Opt-Out" Fallacy:** Thinking you shouldn't play the game because the platform will eventually "close." This is a prisoner's dilemma; if you don't play, a competitor will, and they will use that distribution to kill your business before Stage 3 even arrives.
*   **Chasing Scale over Retention:** Building for a platform with millions of "fly-by" users (e.g., Gemini's accidental clicks) rather than a platform where users are deeply integrated (e.g., ChatGPT's memory/context).
*   **Startup "Chip Spreading":** Trying to build for ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini simultaneously with a 5-person team. This leads to mediocre integrations that fail to trigger the platform's internal discovery algorithms.
*   **Slow Execution:** Treating a platform shift like a standard feature launch. These windows are getting shorter; you must be willing to turn the company strategy on a dime when a platform opens.

**Pitfall to Avoid:** "I'll wait until the winner is clear." 
**Why:** By the time the winner is clear, the organic distribution "alpha" is gone, and the platform has already moved toward Stage 3 (monetization).
