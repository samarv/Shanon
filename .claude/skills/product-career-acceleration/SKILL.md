description: A framework for accelerating product management growth and transitioning from Senior IC to Product Leader. Use this when you feel stuck in your current scope, are preparing for a promotion, or are struggling to delegate as a new manager.

To become a great product manager, you cannot rely on "fake" work or theoretical exercises. You must iterate through a specific learning loop using real data, real customers, and real products. This skill provides the framework for navigating the "Product Leader Canyon"—the difficult transition from doing the work to leading the work.

## The Product Learning Loop
To accelerate your career trajectory, move through these four stages continuously:

1.  **Execute:** Focus on known problems with known solutions. Deliver high-quality work on time. 
2.  **Generalize:** After shipping, extract mental models. Don't just learn "how to build a settings page"; learn "the psychology of user friction" or "high-intent vs. low-intent onboarding."
3.  **Communicate:** Share your generalized learnings. Teaching the organization what works creates trust and leverage.
4.  **Scale:** Use your earned trust to take on "Unknown Problems" with "Unknown Solutions." Move from being given a task to being given a business outcome.

## The "Two Levels" Curiosity Rule
To build sponsorship and increase organizational impact, you must understand the context surrounding your role:
*   **Two Levels Down:** Understand the technical plumbing (e.g., database structure, billing APIs like Stripe, or specific data logging).
*   **Two Levels Up:** Know your manager's priorities and your manager’s manager’s priorities (e.g., what the Board or CEO is focused on this quarter).
*   **Left and Right:** Understand how Sales, Marketing, and Finance view your product. Become the "expert desk" people visit when they have questions.

## Crossing the "Product Leader Canyon"
The shift from IC to Manager often triggers a "Death Spiral" where you work more hours but achieve less leverage. To avoid this:

### 1. Move from Doer to Editor
*   **Stop doing:** Do not take the "most interesting" or "most critical" projects for yourself.
*   **Start editing:** Your job is to "plus" the work of others. Review, provide feedback, and remove blockers.
*   **Practice "ROI Laziness":** Identify the *least* amount of your own effort required to make a project successful.

### 2. Manage the Four Types of Product Work
Avoid the mistake of treating every problem like the one you are best at (e.g., a growth PM treating everything as an A/B test).
*   **Feature Work:** Adding new capabilities to drive engagement for existing users.
*   **Growth Work:** Connecting existing users to existing value (activation, retention, monetization).
*   **PMF Expansion:** Finding new audiences for the same product or new products for the same audience.
*   **Scaling Work:** Tackling bottlenecks created by success (technical debt, trust/safety, user scaling issues).

### 3. Stop Being a "Victim of Resources"
A junior PM works with what they are given. A Product Leader owns the outcome and proposes the necessary resources.
*   **The Script:** "To achieve the goal of [Outcome X] by [Date], I need [Y engineers] and [Z support from Marketing]. If we only have [Current Resources], the expected outcome is [Lower Result]."

## Examples

**Example 1: Generalizing from Execution**
*   **Context:** An IC PM ships a high-friction onboarding flow that surprisingly performs better than the low-friction version.
*   **Application:** Instead of just reporting the metric win, the PM writes a doc explaining "The Theory of Good Friction": for high-complexity products, friction can act as a "setup phase" that increases long-term commitment.
*   **Output:** The PM is now seen as a strategic thinker, not just a task-runner, leading to a promotion to lead the entire activation team.

**Example 2: Avoiding the Death Spiral**
*   **Context:** A new PM Lead is overwhelmed with three sub-teams and is still trying to write the PRDs for the most important feature.
*   **Application:** The Lead stops writing PRDs and instead creates a "Decision Framework" for the junior PMs to follow. They spend their time in 1:1s "editing" the junior PMs' logic rather than doing the research themselves.
*   **Output:** The Lead's capacity doubles, and the junior PMs grow faster because they own the critical work.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **The Manager Death Spiral:** Keeping the most "fun" or "high-stakes" projects for yourself. This blocks your team's growth and ensures you have zero time for high-level strategy.
*   **Over-Specialization:** Applying a "Growth" lens to a "Scaling" problem. Recognize when a problem requires technical debt reduction rather than an experiment.
*   **Sponsorship vs. Mentorship:** Looking for a coach (mentorship) when you actually need someone to give you a bigger opportunity (sponsorship). You earn sponsorship by communicating the business impact of your work to those "two levels up."
*   **Resource Passivity:** Accepting a goal without enough resources and then using "lack of resources" as an excuse for failure. You must negotiate for what is required at the start.
