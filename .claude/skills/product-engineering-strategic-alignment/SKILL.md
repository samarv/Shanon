# Product-Engineering Strategic Alignment

This skill focuses on establishing a "unified front" between product and engineering leadership. When the Product Lead and Engineering Lead are perfectly aligned, the organization avoids "playing Mom against Dad"—a common failure mode where team members seek different opinions from different leaders to bypass decisions.

## The "Unified Front" Process

### 1. Define the Divide and Conquer
Alignment does not mean doing the same work; it means knowing who owns which domain so you can support each other's decisions publicly.
*   **Identify Domains:** Explicitly list which areas the Engineering Lead drives (e.g., technical debt, infrastructure, architectural feasibility) and which the Product Lead drives (e.g., customer value, roadmap prioritization, market fit).
*   **The Deferral Rule:** If a team member asks you for a decision in your partner’s domain, never give a "maybe" or a conflicting opinion. Use the script: "Have you talked to [Partner] about this? That is their domain, and I support their call."

### 2. Implement High-Context Rituals
To maintain alignment without constant meetings, implement these specific leadership rituals used at Slack and Glean:

*   **The Monday Red/Yellow/Green Review:**
    *   **Participants:** Product Lead, Engineering Lead, and their respective Chiefs of Staff.
    *   **Format:** Review top OKRs.
    *   **Rule:** Skip all "Green" items. Only discuss "Red" (blocked) and "Yellow" (at risk) items.
    *   **Action:** Determine immediately if resource shifts are needed (e.g., "We need more mobile engineers here to hit this date").

*   **Shared OKR Marathons:**
    *   Never review OKRs separately. Perform reviews as a duo.
    *   By asking questions together, the team sees that both leaders care about the same metrics and outcomes.

### 3. Transition to Async Efficiency
As the team scales, move from live meetings to asynchronous "Clips" to save hundreds of organizational hours.
*   **The Async OKR Doc:** Teams post their quarterly plan in a dedicated Slack channel.
*   **The Context Clip:** Each team records a 5-minute video (Clip) walking through the 3 most important points of their plan.
*   **The Duo Review:** The Product and Engineering leads watch these clips together in a "marathon" session, noting only the 5–10 teams that require a live follow-up meeting.

## Examples

**Example 1: Resourcing Conflict**
*   **Context:** A high-priority feature is slipping because of a lack of front-end capacity.
*   **Input:** The PM feels the Engineering Lead isn't prioritizing the feature enough.
*   **Application:** Instead of complaining to the team, the PM goes to the Engineering Lead in their weekly "Four-Wall" meeting (Leads + Chiefs of Staff). They present the "Red" status.
*   **Output:** The Engineering Lead says, "I'm on it," and moves engineers from a "Green" project. The PM publicly supports the delay of the "Green" project because they are aligned on the trade-off.

**Example 2: The New Role Evaluation**
*   **Context:** You are interviewing for a Head of Product role.
*   **Input:** You meet the CTO/VP of Engineering.
*   **Application:** Evaluate them as a partner before joining. Ask: "How do you handle it when a PM wants to ship faster than the architecture allows?" or "What is your philosophy on technical debt vs. feature velocity?"
*   **Output:** If there is no mutual respect for the different roles, decline the role. You cannot succeed without an engineering partner you value.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Avoiding Direct Conflict:** If you disagree with your engineering partner, don't stay silent to "keep the peace" and then complain to your team later. Be direct and resolve it behind closed doors so you can emerge aligned.
*   **The "Vocal Minority" Trap:** Over-indexing on the few users unhappy with a change. Align with Engineering on the *long-term* vision (the "tomorrow" users) rather than stalling the roadmap for the "today" users.
*   **Marketing-Speak:** When explaining a tough decision (like unlaunching a feature), being dismissive or using corporate jargon. Instead, be authentic and transparent about *why* the change helps the broader mission.
*   **Inconsistency in Principles:** Not having a shared set of "Product Principles" (e.g., Bezos’s "No Icons" rule). Without shared principles, every decision becomes a new debate.
