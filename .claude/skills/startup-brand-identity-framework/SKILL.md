name: startup-brand-identity-framework
description: A comprehensive framework to define a company's purpose, positioning, and personality. Use this skill when launching a new company or product, during a rebrand, or when internal teams and external customers provide inconsistent descriptions of what the company does.
---

This framework defines a startup's brand beyond visual assets, focusing on the core identity that shapes customer perception and internal decision-making. Use this three-part process to establish a Purpose (why you exist), Positioning (what you do for whom), and Personality (how you show up).

## Part 1: Define Your Purpose
Your purpose is the change you want to see in the world, irrespective of financial gain. It should be a 10-year north star.

### The Purpose Exercise
1.  **List Cultural Tensions:** Identify zeitgeist shifts, current events, or frustrations in your industry (e.g., "Hourly workers feel invisible in the healthcare system").
2.  **Identify the Brand’s Best Self:** Describe the specific value your product delivers when it works perfectly (e.g., "Providing immediate, affordable medical care").
3.  **Synthesize:** Pick one item from each list and combine them into a single sentence.
4.  **Draft the Statement:** Complete the sentence: "We exist to [verb/impact]."

**Example:**
*   *Stripe:* "To increase the GDP of the internet."
*   *LogicLoop:* "To make operations data work harder than operations people."

## Part 2: Nail Product Positioning
Positioning is the specific space you occupy in your target customer's mind. It should be revisited every 18 months.

### Define Your Target Audience
Use the "Concentric Circles" model to narrow your focus:
*   **Circle 1 (Broadest):** Total Addressable Market (TAM).
*   **Circle 4 (Specific):** Your Target Audience for the next 18 months (e.g., "Tech-savvy dads").
*   **The Center Dot:** The Model Persona. Give them a name, job, specific location, and daily frustrations.

### The Positioning Statement
Fill in this classic template:
*   **For** [Target Audience]
*   **Who** [Statement of need or opportunity]
*   **Our Product Name** is a [Category]
*   **That** [Key benefit/Reason to buy]
*   **Unlike** [Primary competitor or old way of doing things]
*   **Our Product** [Statement of primary differentiation].

### The Bar Test
Read your positioning statement aloud. Pretend you are at a bar talking to a friend. If you wouldn't say the words naturally (e.g., using "leverages" or "empowers"), rewrite them in human language.
*   **Bad:** "We empower merchants to leverage mobile payments."
*   **Good:** "We turn your iPad into a point of sale."

## Part 3: Establish Brand Personality
Personality informs your tone of voice and visual style. Use it to create tension that makes the brand memorable.

### Step 1: Spike in Two Dimensions
Select exactly two of these five dimensions to prioritize:
1.  **Sincerity:** Down-to-earth, honest, wholesome.
2.  **Excitement:** Daring, spirited, imaginative.
3.  **Competence:** Reliable, intelligent, successful.
4.  **Sophistication:** Upper class, charming, aspirational.
5.  **Ruggedness:** Outdoorsy, tough.

### Step 2: Create "X, But Not Y" Attributes
Define five personality attributes. To ensure clarity and tension, use the formula: **"We are [Attribute], but not [The extreme/bad version of that attribute]."**
*   "Playful, but not silly."
*   "Daring, but not stupid."
*   "Expert, but not arrogant."

**Example 1: Ed-Tech Brand (Seesaw)**
*   **Purpose:** To create a continuous feedback loop between teachers, students, and parents.
*   **Target:** Elementary school teachers frustrated by the lack of parent engagement.
*   **The Bar Test:** "It's like a digital portfolio that sends your kid's schoolwork straight to your phone."
*   **Personality:** Sincere and Excitement. "Nostalgic, but not dated."

**Example 2: Hardware Brand (Eero)**
*   **Target:** Tech-savvy dads with large homes.
*   **Positioning:** Unlike traditional routers that leave dead zones, Eero blankets your entire home in fast, reliable wifi.
*   **Personality:** Sophistication and Competence. "Minimalist, but not cold."

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
*   **The "Everything to Everyone" Trap:** Trying to target your entire TAM on day one. If you don't focus on a specific circle, your messaging will be too diluted to convert anyone.
*   **Using Corporate "Zombie" Language:** Avoid words like *leverages*, *empowers*, *synergy*, or *robust*. If you wouldn't say it at a bar, don't put it on your website.
*   **Personality Without Tension:** Listing attributes like "Helpful, Nice, and Friendly." These are synonyms, not a personality. Use "X but not Y" to create a distinct "flavor" for the brand.
*   **Sunk Cost Naming:** Sticking with a "code name" or a bad initial name because you've incorporated. If the name is a naming trend (e.g., ending in "-ly" or dropping vowels), it will look dated within five years.
