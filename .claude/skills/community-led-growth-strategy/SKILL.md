# Community-Led Growth Strategy

Community-led growth (CLG) occurs when a community helps a product achieve such name recognition and ubiquity that it de-risks the choice for enterprise buyers. It is not just a forum; it is a mechanism where users become an extension of the marketing and customer success teams.

## The Community Strategy Matrix

Select your community focus based on your product's stage and target audience:

| | **Exploring Product-Market Fit (PMF)** | **Established Product-Market Fit (PMF)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Enterprise-Heavy** | **Customer Advisory Boards**: Converge small circles of ideal-fit users for feedback. They become your first evangelists. | **Champions & Consultants**: Focus on "Champions" inside customer companies and "Consultants" who build businesses around your tool. |
| **Consumer/Prosumer** | **User Testing Groups**: High-touch feedback loops with early adopters to refine the "Atomic Unit of Sharing." | **Ambassadors & Influencers**: Empower vocal power users to create content and host events to drive mass discovery. |

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Identify the "Atomic Unit of Sharing"
Determine what product output users can share to exhibit their own status or expertise.
- **Examples**: Notion Templates, Figma Designs, Canva Graphics, Stripe Atlas guides.
- **Criteria**: The shared item must be "aspirational"—it should make the creator look organized, creative, or successful.

### 2. Recruit the "First 20"
Identify the most vocal users on social platforms (Twitter, Reddit, etc.) who are already sharing your product.
- Do not use a wide net; invite them personally.
- Filter for people who want to share their work to help others, not just for personal gain.
- Launch with a light application process to manage the growth rate and maintain quality.

### 3. Design Non-Transactional Incentives
Avoid paying community members directly for participation. Instead, provide "access" and "status":
- **Early Access**: Give them first looks at new features to let them provide feedback to the product team.
- **Proprietary Space**: Host monthly AMAs or deep dives with the founders and heads of engineering.
- **Subsidize Impact**: Provide budgets for in-person events or swag for their local meetups.
- **Spotlight Creations**: Use company social channels to promote *their* templates or work rather than company news.

### 4. Support the "Consultant Ecosystem"
For products with high complexity, allow the community to monetize their expertise.
- Provide documentation and guides specifically for power users to start their own consulting businesses.
- Connect consultants with each other to form "dense networks" of peer support.

## Measuring Success
Avoid "killing the community with metrics" in the early days. Instead, track:
- **Top of Funnel**: Net new visitors to the website (driven by community word-of-mouth).
- **Discovery Attribution**: Monitor surveys for "How did you hear about us?" specifically looking for "Friend," "Podcast," or "Social Media."
- **Event Frequency**: Number of user-led in-person events per month.

## Examples

**Example 1: The Ambassador Model**
- **Context**: A prosumer productivity app with established PMF.
- **Action**: The team identifies 20 users on Twitter who share screenshots of their setup. They invite them to a private Slack, give them early access to the "API" feature, and provide a badge for their profile.
- **Output**: Those 20 users create YouTube tutorials and sell "Starter Kits," driving thousands of new signups that the company didn't pay for.

**Example 2: The Enterprise Champion Model**
- **Context**: A B2B SaaS tool being used by individual teams within large corporations.
- **Action**: Create a "Champions" Slack specifically for the most active internal users at customer companies.
- **Output**: When IT or Procurement questions the tool's cost, these internal Champions advocate for its necessity, facilitating a "land and expand" motion.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Growth for Growth's Sake**: Adding 5,000 members overnight turns a community into an "auditorium" where no one speaks. Grow in small monthly "batches" (e.g., 20 people) to preserve intimacy.
- **Focusing on ROI Too Early**: If you demand a direct revenue link in month one, you will stifle the organic fervor that makes community valuable.
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: Treating a consultant (who wants to make money) the same as an ambassador (who wants status) leads to low engagement. Tailor the experience to their specific motivation.
