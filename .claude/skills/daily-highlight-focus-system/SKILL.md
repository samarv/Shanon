description: A framework to reclaim time for high-leverage work (Project A) by selecting one daily priority and building environmental barriers against distraction. Use this when you feel like a "reaction machine," struggle to find time for deep work, or feel busy but unproductive.
---

The Daily Highlight system shifts you from reactive efficiency to intentional progress. Instead of trying to do more things faster, you protect one 60–90 minute block for a single "Highlight" that brings the most urgency, satisfaction, or joy to your day.

## I. Choose Your Daily Highlight
Every morning (or the night before), identify the one thing you want to be the centerpiece of your day.

### 1. Selection Criteria
Choose a task that fits one of these three categories:
*   **Urgency:** A pressing task that must be done today (e.g., "Finalize the quarterly roadmap").
*   **Satisfaction:** A "Project A" task—high-leverage, non-urgent work that usually gets pushed aside (e.g., "Draft the new feature PRD").
*   **Joy:** A restorative activity that makes the day meaningful (e.g., "Go sledding with my son" or "Cook a complex dinner").

### 2. Implementation
*   **Duration:** Aim for a 60–90 minute window. This is the "Goldilocks" zone for deep focus.
*   **Externalize it:** Write the Highlight on a physical sticky note and place it on your monitor. 
*   **Block the Calendar:** Treat the Highlight as a non-negotiable appointment. Schedule it during your peak energy hours.

## II. Laser Focus (Protecting the Attention)
Willpower is a finite resource. Instead of resisting distraction, change your "defaults" to make distraction difficult.

### 1. Remove "Infinity Pools"
Identify apps with "pull-to-refresh" mechanisms or endless feeds (Email, Slack, Twitter/X, TikTok, LinkedIn, News).
*   **Delete from phone:** Remove the primary distractors. You can always reinstall them for travel or specific needs, but the default should be "App Not Found."
*   **Log Out:** Force yourself to log in manually on desktop. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) as a deliberate "speed bump" to slow down the impulse to check.
*   **Distraction-Free Workspace:** Go to a location without internet (or disable Wi-Fi) when working on your Highlight.

### 2. Slow Down the Inbox
*   **Batch checking:** Check email 1–2 times per day rather than constant monitoring.
*   **Reset Expectations:** Use an email signature or auto-responder to manage others' expectations: *"I'm checking email twice a day to focus on an important project. If this is urgent, please [text me/call my desk]."*
*   **The "Because" Rule:** When declining meetings or delaying responses, provide a reason. People are significantly more likely to accept a delay if you use the word "because" (e.g., "I'm slow to respond because I'm finishing a critical product brief").

## III. Energize and Reflect
Maintain the physical energy required for focus and iterate on the process.

*   **Environmental Cues:** Charge your phone in a different room (not the bedroom) to prevent late-night/early-morning scrolling.
*   **Daily Reflection:** At the end of the day, look at your sticky note.
    *   Did you accomplish the Highlight?
    *   What distracted you?
    *   What tactic will you experiment with tomorrow?

**Example 1: Strategic Planning**
*   **Context:** A PM is overwhelmed by Slack pings and never gets to the long-term vision doc.
*   **Highlight:** "Complete the 6-month product vision draft."
*   **Laser Tactic:** Move to a conference room with no laptop charger and turn off Wi-Fi.
*   **Output:** A completed draft in 90 minutes that would have otherwise taken a week of intermittent work.

**Example 2: Restorative Joy**
*   **Context:** A founder is burnt out and feels guilty for not working late.
*   **Highlight:** "Family dinner and no-phone evening."
*   **Laser Tactic:** Put the phone in a "charging station" in the kitchen at 6:00 PM and leave it there until morning.
*   **Output:** High-quality family time and recharged mental energy for the next day's work.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **The "Too Small" Highlight:** Don't pick a 5-minute task. A Highlight should be substantial enough to require focus but small enough to fit in 90 minutes.
*   **The "Empty Inbox" Trap:** Treating "Inbox Zero" as a goal. This is reactive work. Your Highlight is the goal; the inbox is just a tool.
*   **White-Knuckling:** Trying to ignore your phone while it's sitting next to you with notifications on. If you can see the "candy" (apps), you will eventually eat it. Physically remove the distraction.
*   **Self-Judgment:** Feeling like a failure if you miss a Highlight. Treat every day as a fresh experiment. If you reinstall an app, just delete it again when you're ready to refocus.
