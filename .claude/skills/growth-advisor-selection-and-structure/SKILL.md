# Growth Advisor Selection and Structure

A "10X" growth advisor can change a company's trajectory with a single insight or sentence. Unlike many disciplines, growth has a high "needle in a haystack" factor where the right person at the right time can drive 1,000% lifts by identifying a single broken lever or an untapped loop.

## Timing: When to Hire
Do not hire a growth advisor until you have **Product-Market Fit (PMF)**.
*   **The Risk:** Growing a product without PMF is damaging. You expose the market to a sub-optimal experience, making it unlikely those users will ever return.
*   **The Exception:** If you need users to gain signal on whether you have PMF, use "off the grid" growth. Pick a specific, isolated market (e.g., one English-speaking country) to contain the growth while you iterate.

## Selection Criteria: Identifying "Signs of Excellence"
Look for "stars" who stand above the crowd based on past performance.

### 1. The Poaching Signal
The strongest signal of a high-performer is when a former boss leaves a company and then returns to "poach" that individual. This indicates the leader—who knows the candidate's work best—is willing to risk their own reputation to hire them again.

### 2. Depth of "Why"
Distinguish between "playbook repeaters" and true experts. 
*   **Playbook Repeaters:** Know a set of tactics that worked at a previous company.
*   **True Experts:** Understand the underlying psychology and mechanics of *why* a lever works and how to evolve it as the platform changes.

### 3. The "Growth Gym" Requirement
Prioritize advisors who have put in "reps" at high-traffic companies (e.g., Pinterest, TripAdvisor, Facebook). These environments provide the necessary volume of experiments to internalize what works and what doesn't.

## Vetting Strategy: Proxy Vetting
If you do not know growth yourself, do not attempt to vet a growth advisor alone.
*   **The Ask:** Reach out to a growth expert in your network (even if they are too busy to advise you). 
*   **The Task:** Ask them to do a "first pass" interview to vet the talent of a potential advisor or full-time hire. 
*   **The Value:** For a true expert, it takes very little time to identify another expert. This is a high-leverage, low-friction request.

## Structuring the Relationship
Align incentives to ensure the advisor is motivated by impact, not hours.

*   **Equity-Only Alignment:** Prefer pure equity compensation. This puts the advisor on the same side of the table as the founder, focusing them on long-term value.
*   **The 3-Month "No-Fault" Cliff:** Include a three-month cliff where either party can "tear up the deal" if it isn't working. This de-risks the engagement for the founder and incentivizes the advisor to add value immediately.
*   **Front-Loaded Vesting:** The advisor’s value is often highest at the beginning. Structure vesting to reflect this, with the goal of the advisor training the internal team to eventually replace them.
*   **The "Relentless Doer" Model:** Instead of relying solely on an advisor, hire an internal "relentless doer" (even if they don't know growth yet) and surround them with 1-2 advisors to accelerate their learning.

## Examples

**Example 1: Scaling a Marketplace**
*   **Context:** A marketplace startup has PMF but is struggling with SEO.
*   **Input:** Founder identifies an SEO expert from a company like TripAdvisor.
*   **Application:** Founder offers a 12-month advisory role with a 3-month cliff and equity compensation. The advisor’s primary KPI is to train the Lead Engineer on SEO mechanics.
*   **Output:** Within 4 months, the Lead Engineer manages the SEO loop internally, and the advisor moves to a "maintenance" check-in once per month.

**Example 2: Vetting a Head of Growth**
*   **Context:** A CEO is hiring their first Head of Growth but doesn't know how to test for depth.
*   **Input:** CEO asks a former growth leader from a successful social platform to do a 30-minute technical screen of the final two candidates.
*   **Application:** The expert asks, "Teach me something about growth I don't know." They evaluate if the candidate understands the "why" or is just repeating a playbook.
*   **Output:** The CEO avoids a "halo hire" who had a large Twitter following but lacked the technical depth to build a sustainable loop.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Hiring the "Halo":** Hiring someone because they have a large social media following or public profile. Public presence does not always correlate with the ability to execute experiments.
*   **Growing Too Early:** Investing in growth levers before retention is stable, resulting in "leaky bucket" syndrome.
*   **Indefinite Dependency:** Keeping an advisor on indefinitely as an "insurance policy" rather than ensuring they transfer their knowledge to the internal team.
*   **Focusing on Activity over Impact:** Rewarding an advisor for the number of meetings held or documents written rather than the lift in North Star metrics.
