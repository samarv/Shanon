description: A tactical framework for crafting and communicating a product vision that aligns teams and excites stakeholders. Use this when kicking off a new product area, preparing for annual planning, or when the team lacks a clear "North Star."

Product vision is not a tagline; it is a vivid picture of the future you are trying to build. This skill provides a structured approach to move from raw user problems to a compelling, high-fidelity narrative that drives team conviction.

## The Core Elements of a Good Vision
Before drafting, ensure your vision meets these four criteria:
1.  **Lofty:** Excites the team and feels worth getting out of bed for.
2.  **Realistic:** Feels attainable and within reach (not pure sci-fi).
3.  **Future-State Focused:** Imagine the world five years out, devoid of today’s technical limitations or debt.
4.  **Problem-Grounded:** Tied to a clear, potent user pain point.

## Step 1: The "Understand Work" (Empathize)
A vision built without a deep understanding of current problems will fail.
*   **Create the "Top 10 Things You Should Know" Document:** This is a living document (e.g., `go/studio-problems`) that lists the 10 most critical problems your users face.
*   **Include Multiple Lenses:** Gather input for this list from:
    *   **Quantitative Data:** Metrics and drop-off points.
    *   **Qualitative Research:** User feedback and pain points.
    *   **Infrastructure/Tech Debt:** "Product debt" that prevents a solid foundation.
*   **Socialize Early:** Ask stakeholders (Marketing, Ops, Engineering) to submit their own "Top 10" lists. Distill these down into a consolidated "Master Top 10" that the entire leadership triad (PM, Eng, Design) agrees on.

## Step 2: The "Mad Libs" Narrative Template
Use this storytelling framework to move from the problem state to the vision state.

*   **Once upon a time:** [Describe the initial state/world of the user]
*   **And then one day:** [Describe the problem or shift that occurred]
*   **Because of that:** [The negative impact on the user]
*   **And because of that:** [The deeper frustration or limitation]
*   **One day, something happened:** [Your product/solution enters the world]
*   **As a result:** [The new state of the world; the vision realized]
*   **Finally:** [The lasting dent you made in the universe/how people feel]

## Step 3: Choose Your Communication Artifact
Don't just use a deck. Use "Future Artifacts" to build conviction.

### The TechCrunch Article
Write the article you hope to see in five years.
*   **The Headline:** A crisp, bold statement of the impact (e.g., "Uber Replaces the Need for Parking").
*   **The Subtitle:** One sentence on what was launched.
*   **The Content:** Write the story of the user's life before and after. Use a real news site logo to make it feel visceral.

### The App Store Mock
Take a screenshot of the Google Play or Apple App Store and blank out the hero images.
*   **The Marquee Mocks:** Draw (even lo-fi) the 3-4 screenshots that show the "Big Rocks" of your solution.
*   **The Value Prop:** What are the 3-4 captions above the screenshots? If you can't fit it in an App Store preview, your vision is too complex.

## Step 4: The Strategy Workshop
To finalize the vision and move toward execution, run a 3-day workshop with your leadership triad:
*   **Day 1: Insights.** Review the "Top 10 Things You Should Know." Do teardowns of competitors (cat-fooding) and your own product (dog-fooding).
*   **Day 2: Strategy/Approach.** Decide which of the 10 problems you will solve first and in what order. 
*   **Day 3: Big Rocks.** Identify the 3-5 massive milestones required to reach the vision.

## Examples

**Example 1: Uber Wallet**
*   **Context:** A Platform PM building commerce infrastructure.
*   **Input:** High-friction payment methods in emerging markets.
*   **Application:** Created a TechCrunch-style headline: "Uber Replaces Your Clipper Card."
*   **Output:** A vision where users could walk into any Bodega, top up with cash, and use their phone for a seamless, cashless ride experience globally.

**Example 2: YouTube Shorts**
*   **Context:** Shifting from long-form polished content to short-form.
*   **Input:** Users feel they can't create because they lack expensive gear or hour-long stories.
*   **Application:** The "Once Upon a Time" framework.
*   **Output:** A vision where "Anyone can express themselves again," shifting YouTube back from a broadcast-only platform to a democratic creation tool.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Waiting for a Designer:** Do not use a lack of design resources as an excuse. Sketch on post-it notes or use low-fidelity wireframes. The story is the most important part.
*   **Peanut-Buttering:** Trying to solve all 10 problems at once. Use "Draconian constraints" (e.g., "If I took all your resources except for five people, what would you build?") to force a choice.
*   **Confusing Mission and Vision:** Remember: Mission is the "Why" (e.g., "Transportation as reliable as running water"). Vision is the "What it looks like" (e.g., "A city with zero parking lots").
*   **Updating Too Often:** A good vision should last 3-5 years. If you are changing it every year, you haven't done enough "Understand Work" to find the North Star.
