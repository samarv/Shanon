description: A methodology for transitioning from a slow, divisional bureaucracy to a high-velocity functional organization. Use this when your company is suffering from "politics" (advocating for individual interests), "bureaucracy" (meetings about meetings), or a lack of cohesive product vision.

This framework is designed to return a company to its "startup roots" by centralizing decision-making, integrating product and marketing, and putting leaders deep into the details of the work.

## Core Pillars of the Model

### 1. Functional over Divisional Structure
Eliminate "General Managers" or "Business Unit" heads who act as mini-CEOs of their own silos.
*   **Organize by expertise:** Group people by function (Design, Engineering, Product Marketing, Sales) rather than by product line or region.
*   **Expert Leadership:** Every leader must be a domain expert. A design leader manages the design first and the people second. Avoid "people managers" who do not understand the technical or creative details of the work.
*   **Centralize decision-making:** Pull decision-making up to a "shared consciousness" of the top leaders to ensure the entire company rows in one direction.

### 2. The Integrated Product Marketer (PM + PMM)
Traditional Product Management is split. Airbnb combined the "inbound" (development) and "outbound" (marketing) into a single role.
*   **Product Marketing as the Core:** The PM must be able to both build the product and tell the story of the product.
*   **Story-Led Development:** Start with the story/press release and work backward to the features. If you can't explain why it's great, the product shouldn't exist.
*   **Outsource Coordination:** Move "program management" (scheduling, tracking) to dedicated Program Managers so Product Marketers can focus on product quality and distribution.

### 3. One Shared Roadmap
Eliminate fragmented team-level roadmaps that create dependencies and "deli-style" backups.
*   **The Single Sheet:** Document every project in the company in one place.
*   **Rolling 2-Year Plan:** Maintain a strategy that looks two years out, updated every six months, with specific launches every May and November/October.
*   **No Unofficial Projects:** If it isn't on the company roadmap, it doesn't get built. This prevents teams from building "their own" marketing or platform teams to bypass bottlenecks.

## Implementation Steps

### The "Details" Review Cadence
As a leader, shift from "delegating and empowering" (which often leads to drift) to "being in the details."
1.  **Map the Reviews:** Set a cadence for every project (weekly, bi-weekly, or every 4, 8, or 12 weeks).
2.  **Review the Work, Not the Deck:** Do not look at status slides. Look at the actual UI, the code, or the marketing copy. 
3.  **Score for Execution:** Use a Head Program Manager to score every project:
    *   **Green:** On track to ship.
    *   **Yellow/Red:** Blocked or delayed.
4.  **Identify Bottlenecks:** Use these reviews to spot where an engineer is stuck or where two functions aren't collaborating, and resolve it immediately in the room.

### The "Add a Zero" Exercise
When a team presents a goal, use the "Add a Zero" prompt to force first-principles thinking.
*   **The Question:** "What would it take to make this 10x bigger, 10x faster, or 10x better?"
*   **The Goal:** Not necessarily to hit the 10x goal, but to break current assumptions. 10x growth usually requires a completely different process, not just "working harder."

### Marketing as "Chandelier" Education
Move away from performance marketing (the "laser" that lights a corner) toward brand education (the "chandelier" that lights the room).
*   **Product Marketing = Education:** Focus marketing on teaching users about new features.
*   **Waiters and Chefs:** Treat Marketing (Waiters) and Engineering (Chefs) as a single unit. Marketing knows what the customer wants; Engineers know how to make it. They must be "joined at the hip."

## Examples

**Example 1: Resolving Siloed Development**
*   **Context:** A company has a "Guest" team and a "Host" team. They are building conflicting rating systems.
*   **Application:** Dissolve the divisional teams. Move all designers into a central Design function and all engineers into Engineering. Create one "Ratings and Trust" project on the single company roadmap.
*   **Output:** A cohesive UI that works for both sides of the marketplace, reviewed personally by the CEO to ensure "one voice."

**Example 2: The Project Audit**
*   **Context:** A founder feels the company is moving slow despite hiring 500 new people.
*   **Application:** Require every team to list every active project in a Google Sheet. Discover 3,000 active projects.
*   **Output:** Force a "cut to 20%." Reassign the people from the cancelled 80% to the remaining 20%. Instead of 1,000 teams doing 3 things each, have 3 teams doing one thing.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

*   **Apologizing for Your Style:** Many founders find a "midpoint" between how they want to lead and how employees want to be led. This creates a "slow-moving bureaucracy." Commit to the model fully.
*   **AB Testing Without a Hypothesis:** Don't test "Blue vs. Green." Testing without a hypothesis leads to a "hodgepodge" product. Use data to validate a cohesive vision, not to replace it.
*   **The "Delegation Trap":** Thinking that a leader's only job is to "hire and empower." If you aren't in the details, you don't know if the people you "empowered" are actually doing a good job.
*   **UX/Marketing Split:** Having "UX Writers" and "Marketing Writers" in different orgs. This results in a product that sounds like two different people. Combine all writing under one voice.
