name: b2b-category-creation-strategy
description: A framework for determining when to create a new software category versus winning an existing one, and the tactical steps to define and validate that category. Use this when your product is too disruptive for current labels, when existing categories have negative associations, or when you need to expand your TAM.

Category creation is the strategic process of defining a new space in the market to escape commoditization and define the criteria for success. Rather than fighting for market share in a crowded room, you build a new room where you are the leader and the benchmark.

## Category Selection Criteria
Before committing to category creation, evaluate your product against these three signals to decide if you should invent a new category or optimize an existing one.

*   **Market Scope:** Is your current category label (e.g., "Online Whiteboard") too small to contain your vision? If the label limits your perceived value to a single niche, create a broader category (e.g., "Visual Collaboration").
*   **Budget Alignment:** Do customers already have a line item for what you do? If yes, it is often better to "elevate" the existing category rather than rename it. If no, you must create the category to justify a new budget allocation.
*   **Language Resonance:** Listen to how customers describe their pain. If they use industry-standard terms (e.g., "ATS"), fighting that language is expensive. If they lack words for the solution, you have an opening to name it.

## The Hybrid Execution Model
You do not have to choose between an old category and a new one immediately. Use a "bottoms-up" transition:
1.  **Sell into the existing category:** Rank on directory sites (G2, Capterra) for established terms to capture immediate intent and existing budget.
2.  **Market the new category:** Use thought leadership and content to educate the market on a "better way," gradually shifting the brand toward the new definition.

## Tactical Implementation Steps

### 1. External Validation
A category isn't real until others acknowledge it. 
*   **Analyst Briefings:** Meet with Gartner, Forrester, and G2 Crowd. Explain why your features don't fit existing boxes. Demand a new tag or category listing based on differentiated feature sets.
*   **The Competition Signal:** Welcome competitors who use your new terminology. A category requires multiple players to be validated by analysts; being the "only" one often means you are just a niche product.

### 2. Thought Leadership & Education
Since there is no existing budget, you must teach the buyer why they need to create one.
*   **Pain Point Packaging:** Group disparate features (e.g., mind mapping, diagramming, whiteboarding) under a single value proposition (e.g., "Visual Collaboration").
*   **Content Volume:** Produce high-velocity content that explains "Why now?" and "Why this category?" rather than just "Why this product?"

### 3. Internal Alignment
*   **Brand Essence:** Ensure your values (e.g., Agility, Candor) are reflected in the category name and visual system.
*   **Sales Enablement:** Give sales teams "bridge language" that acknowledges the old category while pivoting to the new one during pitches.

## Examples

**Example 1: Expanding the Scope**
*   **Context:** A company is labeled an "Online Whiteboard," which limits them to education or small design teams.
*   **Application:** They rename the category to "Visual Collaboration." They brief analysts on how the platform serves HR, Marketing, and Engineering, not just designers. 
*   **Output:** They move from a "nice-to-have" tool to an enterprise-wide "must-have" platform with a dedicated budget.

**Example 2: Elevating a "Bad" Category**
*   **Context:** A company creates a high-end Applicant Tracking System (ATS), but the term "ATS" is hated by users for being transactional.
*   **Attempt:** They try to create "Recruiting Optimization Platform." 
*   **Pivot:** They realize buyers still search for and budget for "ATS." They abandon the new name but invest in content to make the "ATS" category more strategic and valuable, effectively winning the existing category through superior positioning.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Fighting the Budget:** Trying to create a new category name when buyers are strictly forced to spend from an existing line item (e.g., "Performance Management").
*   **Naming for the Sake of Naming:** Inventing a complex name that customers don't use in real conversations. If they don't say it, it won't stick.
*   **Going Top-Down Only:** Focusing only on PR and analysts while ignoring how actual users describe their day-to-day problems.
*   **Premature Scaling:** Investing in a massive category rebrand before you have confirmed product-market fit and a repeatable sales motion.
