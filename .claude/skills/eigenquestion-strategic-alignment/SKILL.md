description: Identify the "Eigenquestion"—the single most discriminating question that, once answered, resolves a cascade of subsequent downstream decisions. Use this when a team is stuck in a circular "good vs. evil" debate or when a product strategy lacks a clear anchor.

The Eigenquestion framework is a strategic tool used to simplify complex decision-making by identifying the question that provides the most leverage. Instead of answering a list of 20 tactical questions, you find the one question that makes the other 19 obvious.

## The Eigenquestion Process

### 1. Identify the Circular Debate
Look for "good vs. evil" debates where two sides have valid but opposing viewpoints (e.g., "Do what's right for the user" vs. "Do what's right for the business"). If the team is having the same meeting repeatedly without resolution, you are likely focused on a downstream symptom rather than the Eigenquestion.

### 2. List and Rank Subsequent Questions
Write down every tactical question the team is currently trying to answer. Instead of ranking them by "importance," rank them by **leverage**:
- If we answer Question A, does it make Question B irrelevant?
- If we answer Question C, does the answer to Question D become obvious?

### 3. Abstract to the Core Trade-off
Shift the conversation from the specific tactical choice to a theoretical, long-term trade-off. Frame the question as a choice between two "goods" or two different market philosophies that will hold true for the next decade.

### 4. Practice with Low-Stakes Scenarios
To build the skill of identifying leverage, practice with "neutral court" scenarios.
- **The Teleporter Test:** Imagine scientists invented a teleporter. To build a business plan, you can only ask two questions.
- **Bad Questions:** "How big is it?" (Tactical, low leverage).
- **Eigenquestions:** "Is it safe for humans?" and "Is it expensive CapEx (to buy) or OpEx (to run)?"
- **Outcome:** The answers to these two questions immediately dictate whether you are replacing airports, heart-transplant couriers, or fax machines.

## Case Study Examples

### Example 1: YouTube’s "Modern Family" Problem
**The Context:** In 2008, YouTube users searched for *Modern Family*, but YouTube didn't have the rights. The team debated: "Should we link out to ABC.com to satisfy the user?"
- **The Tactical Debate:** "Link out" (User-first) vs. "Don't link out" (Business-first).
- **The Eigenquestion:** "In a decade, will the online video market value **Consistency** (knowing exactly how the player/returns/experience works) or **Comprehensiveness** (having everything, even if the experience is fragmented)?"
- **The Decision:** The team chose **Consistency**.
- **Downstream Results:** This answered the "link out" question (No), the iPhone app strategy (Take it back from Apple to ensure a consistent experience), and the decision to stop embedding third-party players.

### Example 2: Coda’s Identity
**The Context:** Defining a product that is "a doc as powerful as an app."
- **The Tactical Debate:** Should we prioritize "app-like" features (buttons, automations) or "doc-like" features (text flow, comments)?
- **The Eigenquestion:** "Are we a Doc or an App?" If a user misperceives the product, which direction of misunderstanding is safer?
- **The Decision:** Coda chose **Doc**.
- **Downstream Results:** The company name was chosen (Coda is "a doc" backwards), the pricing model was built around "Makers" (document creators), and the onboarding flow mimics a blinking cursor.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Ranking by Importance, Not Leverage:** The most "important" decision (e.g., "How do we make money?") is rarely the Eigenquestion. The Eigenquestion is the one that tells you *how* you will make money.
- **Staying in "Home Court":** Don't try to find Eigenquestions while staring at your own messy data. Practice on "Away Court" problems (other companies' products) to sharpen the ability to see patterns without bias.
- **Accepting "Both":** If your answer to an Eigenquestion is "we value both," you haven't found the Eigenquestion yet. A true Eigenquestion forces a difficult trade-off between two valid paths.
- **Focusing on the "How" too early:** (The PSHE Trap). Don't let "How" (execution/rituals) distract from the "P" (identifying the right problem via the right question).
