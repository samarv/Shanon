description: Transition from a feature-led "problem-solution" pitch to a movement-led narrative that aligns sales, marketing, and product. Use this when launching a new category, scaling beyond founder-led sales, or when your product feels like a commodity in a crowded market.

The Strategic Narrative moves away from the "arrogant doctor" approach (identifying a pain and prescribing a solution) and instead frames the company as a guide helping the customer win a "new game" created by a fundamental shift in the world.

## The Five-Step Framework

### 1. Name the Shift (Old Game vs. New Game)
Identify a fundamental change in the world that makes the old way of doing things obsolete and the new way necessary for success.
*   **Action:** Define the "Old Game" (how things used to be) and the "New Game" (the current reality).
*   **Key Requirement:** The naming must be concise and binary.
*   *Example:* Transactions (Old) vs. Subscriptions (New); Opinions (Old) vs. Reality (New).

### 2. Name the Stakes
Show that the shift has created winners and losers. You must demonstrate that the future is not just "okay"—it is a split between a very negative outcome and a very positive one.
*   **Action:** Cite specific "winners" who have already embraced the new game.
*   **Action:** Define the "death" of those who stay in the old game. 
*   **Nuance:** Use the "reluctant buyer" concept. Just as a movie hero needs a reason to leave home (like the stakes being raised to life-or-death), your prospect needs to see that staying put is a fatal risk.

### 3. Name the Object of the New Game
Define a simple, high-level goal that the hero (your customer) is trying to achieve in this new world.
*   **Action:** Frame this as a mission or a "Promised Land" message.
*   **Technique:** Phrase this as a question to invite collaboration: "What would it take to [achieve the goal]?"
*   *Example:* "What would it take to turn every customer into a subscriber?" or "How do we belong anywhere?"

### 4. Identify the Obstacles
Acknowledge why winning the new game is difficult. If the goal were easy to achieve, your product wouldn't need to exist.
*   **Action:** Re-frame traditional "problems" as monsters or obstacles preventing the customer from reaching the Promised Land.
*   **Alignment:** This section sets the stage for your product features without them feeling like a sales pitch.

### 5. Present the Magic Gifts
Introduce your product features as the tools or "magic gifts" that help the hero overcome the specific obstacles mentioned in Step 4.
*   **Action:** Map every major product capability directly to an obstacle.
*   **Action:** Use success stories and demos as proof that these gifts actually work in the new game.

## Application Guide

### Testing the Narrative
Do not roll out a new narrative to the entire company at once. Use a "lean" approach:
1.  **The Draft:** Create a "shit draft" (as a CEO or founder) and present it to a small internal team.
2.  **The Customer Interview:** Ask current customers if they see the same "shift" you have identified. Listen for the exact words they use to describe it.
3.  **The Sales Test:** Present the "Shift" and "Stakes" in a real sales call. Watch for the "nod"—if the prospect starts telling you stories of how that shift is affecting them, the narrative is working.

### Using Narrative as a Product North Star
A successful strategic narrative acts as a filter for the product roadmap:
*   **Rule:** If a feature request helps the customer win the "New Game," prioritize it.
*   **Rule:** If a feature request reinforces the "Old Game" (even if customers ask for it), reject or deprioritize it.

## Examples

**Example 1: Sales Coaching (Gong)**
*   **The Shift:** From "Opinions" (sales reps reporting what they think happened) to "Reality" (analyzing what was actually said on recorded calls).
*   **The Stakes:** Winners use AI to see reality; losers rely on gut feel and miss targets.
*   **The Object:** Achieve "Revenue Intelligence."
*   **The Obstacle:** How do you listen to thousands of hours of calls to find patterns?
*   **The Magic Gift:** AI-driven insights that automatically flag high-risk deals and winning behaviors.

**Example 2: Corporate Training (360Learning)**
*   **The Shift:** From "Top-Down Learning" (centralized experts pushing content) to "Upskill from Within" (democratized knowledge sharing).
*   **The Stakes:** Companies that can't move fast enough to train employees on new tech (like EVs or AI) will fail.
*   **The Object:** Turn every internal expert into a champion of learning.
*   **The Obstacle:** Experts don't know how to create courses; the learning department lacks control.
*   **The Magic Gift:** Collaborative tools that allow anyone to create a course in minutes while maintaining oversight.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Template Blindness:** Blindly copying the "Zuora deck" structure without finding a shift unique to your specific market.
*   **Lack of CEO Ownership:** Delegating the narrative to a marketing manager. The CEO must drive this because it dictates strategy, hiring, and product, not just messaging.
*   **Being Too Verbose:** Failing to name the "Old Game" and "New Game" in 1-2 words. If you can't name the movement concisely, people won't join it.
*   **Starting with the Product:** Leading with features before establishing why the world has changed. If the prospect doesn't agree the world has changed, they won't care about your solution.
*   **Focusing on the Label:** Obsessing over a "category name" (e.g., "Revenue Intelligence") rather than the story behind why that category exists.
