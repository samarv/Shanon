# Startup PR Outreach Framework

Most startups fail at PR because they use "marketing-speak" that obscures their value. To get coverage, you must transition from promotional language to tactical storytelling that emphasizes human impact, competition, and news-worthy trends.

## Core Principles
- **Pattern Match to the "Beat":** Reporters cover specific "beats" (e.g., FinTech, AI, Future of Work). Map your pitch to their specific interest area.
- **Reference Incumbents, Don't "Create Categories":** Reporters understand your product better when you frame it against a household name. Instead of saying "We are creating a new category of X," say "We are taking on [Incumbent] by doing [Specific Advantage]."
- **The "Exclusive" Leverage:** Offer your story to one reporter first. Use the phrasing: "We are offering this to you as an exclusive, meaning we won't pitch anyone else if you take the story."
- **Ruthless Conciseness:** The most successful pitches are often only three sentences long.

## The Pitch Structure
Use this structure for emails or DMs (Twitter/LinkedIn):

1.  **The Context (Subject Line):** Make it direct. "Funding/Launch: [Company] raising $[Amount] from [Top VC]" or "[Column Name] Guest Idea: [Topic]."
2.  **The Hook (1-2 Sentences):** Define exactly what you do without jargon. Use a "Like X but Y" comparison if possible.
3.  **The Proof (1 Sentence):** Mention your lead investors, a hard growth metric (e.g., "hit six figures in ARR in 4 months"), or a specific high-profile partnership.
4.  **The Ask:** Ask if they want the exclusive or an intro meeting.

## Media Targeting Guide
- **TechCrunch:** The go-to for funding announcements and early startup launches. Keep it simple: Amount, Investors, Space.
- **Axios:** Use for deals, FinTech, or healthcare. They are "deals-focused" and rarely cover pure product news without a monetary component.
- **VentureBeat:** Best for technical AI news and enterprise product updates.
- **Fast Company:** Target for "Future of Work," design, or leadership-oriented op-eds.
- **Business Insider:** Target for "Entrepreneurial Journey" stories or pitch deck features.

## Jargon Removal Checklist
Before sending, strip out these common PR "blunders" identified in the transcript:
- **Instead of:** "Robust multiplayer experience" → **Use:** "Collaborative for teams."
- **Instead of:** "Human in the loop collaboration" → **Use:** "Task automation verified by humans."
- **Instead of:** "Category-defining platform" → **Use:** "A faster alternative to [Competitor]."
- **Avoid:** Disingenuous growth stats (e.g., "700% growth" when moving from 1 to 7 customers). Use hard numbers like ARR or specific user types instead.

## Examples

**Example 1: Funding Pitch (TechCrunch Style)**
> **Context:** Exclusive Launch: MarTech startup raising $8M from Sequoia
>
> **Input:** Reaching out with a MarTech company that’s raised $8M from Sequoia. They are taking on Salesforce with a mobile-first approach that automates lead follow-ups via AI. Would you be interested in an exclusive on the funding and launch story?

**Example 2: Podcast Pitch (Guest Idea)**
> **Context:** Guest idea for [Podcast Name]: How NewBank grew 90% organically
>
> **Input:** I’ve been following your episodes on growth tactics. I have a guest idea: the CPO of NewBank. Two fun facts: their growth is 85% organic because of a specific "customer fanaticism" framework, and they are now bigger than Coinbase and Robinhood combined. Would you be open to an intro?

## Common Pitfalls
- **Being Rigid on Dates:** Do not force a launch date. Optimize for the reporter’s schedule. If they need four more days to write a better story, take the delay.
- **Mass Blasting:** Sending the same pitch to 50 reporters is a "black hole" strategy. Pitch 1-6 highly relevant reporters individually.
- **Assuming "Warm Intros" Matter:** A cold email with a great "nugget" of news is more effective than a warm intro with a boring story. Reporters care about the story, not the relationship.
- **Relying on Press Releases:** Reporters don't check news wires anymore. Use a personalized blog post or a direct pitch instead of a $2,000 wire service.
