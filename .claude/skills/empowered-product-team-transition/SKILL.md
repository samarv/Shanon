description: Shift a product squad from a "feature factory" (shipping output) to an "empowered team" (solving problems). Use this when you are handed a rigid roadmap of features, when engineers feel like "order-takers," or when product launches fail to move business metrics.

Moving from a feature team to an empowered product team is the difference between being a "project manager" herding cats and a "product manager" driving business value. This framework allows you to run a low-risk experiment to prove the value of outcome-based product management.

## The Three Sacred Access Points
Before starting a transition, you must ensure the Product Manager has unencumbered, direct access to three groups. Without these, the role is effectively paralyzed:
1.  **Users and Customers:** You must be able to talk to them directly without "gatekeepers" (Sales, Support, or Research) blocking the path.
2.  **Engineers:** You must work daily with developers to solve problems, not just hand off requirements.
3.  **Stakeholders:** You must understand the constraints of Legal, Finance, Sales, and Marketing directly to ensure the solution is "viable."

## The 4-Part PM Preparation
To earn the right to lead an empowered team, the PM must bring four specific areas of expertise to the table that designers and engineers do not have:
*   **Customer Knowledge:** Deep understanding of user pain points (ideally from 30+ recent customer interviews).
*   **Data Expertise:** Mastery of user analytics, sales data, and warehouse metrics.
*   **Business Savvy:** Understanding how the product is sold, marketed, financed, and regulated.
*   **Market/Competitive Landscape:** Knowledge of industry trends and what competitors are building.

## Step-by-Step: The "Empowered Experiment"
Instead of asking for a total organizational overhaul, pitch a one-quarter experiment for a single team.

### 1. The Pitch to Management
Ask your manager: "For the next quarter, let our team try running as an empowered team. We will focus on a specific problem rather than a list of features. If we don't move the needle, we'll go back to the old roadmap model."

### 2. Reverse-Engineer the Roadmap
If you are handed a feature (e.g., "Build a Buy Now, Pay Later option"), go to the stakeholder and ask:
*   "How are you measuring the success of this feature?"
*   "What business problem is this intended to solve?"
*   **Goal:** Turn the *output* (the feature) into an *outcome* (e.g., "Increase checkout conversion by 15%").

### 3. Conduct Rapid Solution Discovery
Once you have the problem, focus on "Solution Discovery." Do not spend weeks "validating the problem" if the business already knows it exists. Focus on the **Four Risks**:
*   **Value:** Will the customer buy/use it? (PM Owned)
*   **Viability:** Does this work for our business/legal/finance? (PM Owned)
*   **Usability:** Can the user figure out how to use it? (Designer Owned)
*   **Feasibility:** Can we build this with our current technology? (Engineer Owned)

### 4. Continuous Engagement
*   **Involve Engineers Early:** Bring developers into discovery. Let them see the customer pain points firsthand.
*   **High-Fidelity Prototypes:** Test prototypes with users and stakeholders *before* writing a single line of production code.

## Examples

**Example 1: From Feature to Outcome**
*   **Context:** A stakeholder demands a "Chatbot" for the support page.
*   **Input:** The roadmap says "Deploy Chatbot in Q3."
*   **Application:** Ask the stakeholder for the success metric. They reveal they want to reduce support ticket volume by 20%.
*   **Output:** The team is now empowered to find the best way to reduce tickets. They might find that improving the "Reset Password" flow (a 5-minute fix) is more effective than a 3-month chatbot build.

**Example 2: Managing Stakeholder Viability**
*   **Context:** Building a new payment flow in a regulated market.
*   **Input:** Legal is worried about compliance; Marketing is worried about branding.
*   **Application:** The PM brings a high-fidelity prototype to Legal and Marketing *during discovery*. They identify that a specific checkbox is required for compliance and a certain color palette for branding.
*   **Output:** The "How" is solved during discovery. When the engineers start building, they have the confidence that the solution is already approved by all "viability" stakeholders.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Spending Too Long on "Problem Validation":** Don't waste time proving the problem exists if the founder or data already confirmed it. Move to "Solution Discovery" immediately to save time for iterations.
*   **Delegating the "Sacred Three":** Never let a "Product Ops" person or "Project Manager" handle your communication with engineers or stakeholders. If you lose that direct link, you lose the ability to innovate.
*   **Scaling with Process Instead of Leaders:** Avoid heavy frameworks (like SAFe) that emphasize "following the process." Scale by hiring and coaching strong PM leaders who can make independent decisions.
*   **Confusing Product Owner with Product Manager:** A Product Owner is an administrative role (managing Jira/backlogs). A Product Manager is a strategic role responsible for value and viability. Ensure your "Product Owners" are trained in discovery, not just backlog grooming.
