# High-Frequency Shipping Tempo Framework

A team’s "tempo"—the frequency and consistency with which they ship—is more important than its organizational design. Real professionals ship at a high frequency regardless of their function. This framework moves teams away from endless planning and toward a predictable cadence of output by defining exactly "what good looks like" in terms of volume and speed.

## 1. Establish the Strategic Foundation
Before setting a tempo, the team must be aligned on the "North Star" to ensure speed doesn't lead to wasted effort.

*   **Define the Mission Metric:** Identify one primary metric that signifies value. (e.g., For a growth tool, the mission metric might be "Total Revenue processed for customers").
*   **Set Guiding Principles:** Establish how you will reach that metric. (e.g., "We will be the most helpful brand in the space" or "We will automate the work for the user").

## 2. Define "What Good Looks Like" (The Tempo)
Every department leader must define a specific shipping frequency for their team that aligns with the mission.

*   **Quantify Output:** Determine the exact number of "ships" required per period.
    *   *Marketing:* "We ship 4 podcast episodes and 2 video series per month."
    *   *Product:* "We ship 1 medium feature per month and 1 major launch per quarter."
*   **Get Leadership Buy-in:** Ensure the CEO and department heads agree that these numbers constitute a "high-performing" tempo.

## 3. The "Close the Gap" Management Style
Shift management conversations from subjective performance reviews to objective tempo analysis. If a team is not hitting the agreed-upon frequency, use a diagnostic approach:

1.  **Identify the Gap:** "We agreed on one launch per month, but we only did one this quarter. Why?"
2.  **Surface the Blocker:** Is it a resource constraint (hiring), a dependency (waiting on another team), or a process issue?
3.  **Resolve the Constraint:** The leader's job is to solve the specific bottleneck so the team can return to the target tempo.
4.  **Avoid Individual Blame:** Do not assume "Tim sucks" if output is low; assume the organizational "nexus" or resources are failing Tim until proven otherwise.

## 4. Operationalize the Cross-Functional Nexus
Tempo often breaks at the hand-off between departments. Create a "nexus" to synchronize speeds.

*   **Product-Marketing Alignment:** If Marketing needs to ship one announcement per month but Product is building one massive feature over six months, the Product lead must identify smaller "hidden" improvements to hand to Marketing.
*   **Positioning Buffers:** Allow Marketing to handle the "hype" and positioning of smaller updates to maintain their content tempo without over-promising technical capabilities.

## Examples

**Example 1: Content Marketing Tempo**
*   **Context:** A marketing team is producing high-quality blog posts, but they only come out once every two months, leading to low traffic growth.
*   **Input:** The goal is to become a "helpful brand."
*   **Application:** Leadership sets a tempo of "one Pricing Page Teardown video per week."
*   **Output:** The team stops agonizing over "perfect" long-form essays and builds a repeatable production line for videos. Traffic becomes predictable because the "tempo" is fixed.

**Example 2: Product Launch Alignment**
*   **Context:** The engineering team is shipping code daily, but the market perceives the company as "stagnant" because there are no big announcements.
*   **Input:** A target of "one public-facing launch per month."
*   **Application:** The Product Manager looks at the dev log and identifies a new API integration and a UI refresh that were already finished. They package these as "The Connectivity Update."
*   **Output:** Marketing has a concrete "ship" to promote, maintaining the company’s "high-growth" reputation while the core team continues working on a 6-month infrastructure project.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Confusing "Busy" with "Shipping":** Shipping means a deliverable reached the customer (a published post, a live feature, a sent email). Internal meetings and docs are not "ships."
*   **Ignoring Support Quality:** Do not increase tempo if NPS is below 20 or support tickets are spiking. High frequency requires a baseline of functional quality.
*   **Setting Unrealistic Baselines:** If you currently ship once a year, do not set a tempo of once a week. Move from annual to quarterly, then quarterly to monthly.
*   **Infantilizing the Team:** Avoid using HR or "happiness" as an excuse for low output. High-performers are generally happiest when they are shipping regularly and seeing their work in the wild.
