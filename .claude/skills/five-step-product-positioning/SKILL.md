description: A systematic framework to define your product's unique value and market context. Use this when launching a new product, struggling to win deals against established competitors, or when your sales team can't clearly explain why you are better than a spreadsheet.

Positioning is the act of defining the context for your product so that your unique value is obvious to your best-fit customers. Instead of starting with a market category, this framework builds from the ground up based on what you actually beat in the real world.

## The Five-Step Positioning Process

### 1. Identify Competitive Alternatives
Define what a customer would do if your product didn't exist. 
- **Include the Status Quo:** In B2B, roughly 40% of deals are lost to "no decision." Your real competition is often a spreadsheet, an intern, or "the way we've always done it."
- **Identify the Shortlist:** List the other products that actually land on the customer's shortlist when they decide to buy.

### 2. List Differentiated Capabilities
Document the specific features or capabilities you have that the competitive alternatives do not.
- **Product Features:** Unique functionality or technical specs.
- **Company Capabilities:** Pricing models, specialized professional services, or unique delivery methods.

### 3. Translate Capabilities into Value
For every differentiated capability, ask: "So what? Why does the customer care?"
- Group these benefits into 2–3 "Value Buckets" or themes.
- **The Filter:** Only include value that is *differentiated*. If a competitor can also provide that value, it is not a positioning pillar.

### 4. Define Your Best-Fit Customer
Not everyone who has the problem will care about your unique value equally. 
- Identify the specific characteristics (industry, team size, technical stack, urgency) of the accounts that would find your "Value Buckets" indispensable.
- Focus on the segment where you have the highest win rate.

### 5. Select the Market Category
Pick the context (e.g., "CRM for SMBs" or "Security Orchestration") that makes your value obvious.
- **Rule of Thumb:** If you have to spend 20 minutes explaining what you are, you are in the wrong category.
- The category should trigger a set of assumptions in the customer's mind that work in your favor.

## Examples

**Example 1: Specialized Project Management Tool**
- **Context:** A PM tool for boutique architectural firms.
- **Competitive Alternative:** Generic tools like Trello or physical blueprints/email.
- **Differentiated Capability:** Built-in CAD file viewer and automated permit tracking.
- **Value Mapping:** "Reduced revision cycles" and "Automated compliance."
- **Target Customer:** Firms with 10-50 employees handling municipal contracts.
- **Market Category:** "Compliance-First Architecture Management Platform."

**Example 2: Data Analytics Startup**
- **Context:** A tool for marketing teams to track attribution.
- **Competitive Alternative:** Google Analytics (Status Quo) or expensive enterprise BI tools.
- **Differentiated Capability:** One-click integration with 50+ ad platforms.
- **Value Mapping:** "Real-time ROI visibility without data engineering."
- **Target Customer:** Performance marketing leads at mid-market e-commerce brands.
- **Market Category:** "Ad-Spend Attribution Engine."

## Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring the Status Quo:** Focusing only on "head-to-head" competitors while failing to realize the customer is perfectly happy staying with their current "crappy" manual process.
- **Starting with Category First:** Choosing a category (e.g., "We are an AI company") before understanding your differentiated value. This forces you to "back up" into a positioning that might not fit.
- **Feature Dumping:** Listing 20 features instead of 2–3 cohesive value themes. Customers cannot remember more than three reasons why you are better.
- **Positioning for Everyone:** Trying to appeal to the whole market. Effective positioning is a "stake in the ground" that explicitly excludes customers who aren't a perfect fit.
