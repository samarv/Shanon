description: A framework for identifying, analyzing, and responding to existential startup threats. Use this skill when your runway is suddenly jeopardized (Cash Crisis) or when market shifts, regulation, or competition make your product irrelevant (Product-Market Fit Crisis).

Building a startup is a journey from one crisis to the next. Successful survival requires shifting from "victim mode" to "responsibility mode," making high-conviction decisions, and acting with extreme speed to preserve optionality.

## 1. Diagnose the Crisis Type
Identify which of the two primary existential threats you are facing:
*   **Cash Crisis:** Your financial plan is jeopardized by a disappearing investor, a lost major customer, or a sudden market price shift.
*   **Product-Market Fit (PMF) Crisis:** Your value proposition is no longer valid due to new regulations, a superior competitor launch, or a fundamental shift in user behavior.

## 2. The Crisis Action Algorithm
Once a crisis is identified, immediately answer these three questions to determine your response velocity:
1.  **What is the specific impact?** (e.g., "We lost 50% of monthly revenue" or "Our data source is now illegal").
2.  **How long will this last?** (e.g., "This is a permanent regulatory shift" vs. "This is a two-season market dip").
3.  **What is the new time-to-death?** Recalculate your runway based on the *current* reality, not the previous projection.

**Rule of Action:** You must decide on your plan today. If you wait 3–6 months to cut costs or pivot, you lose the leverage of time, and your options disappear.

## 3. Respond to a Cash Crisis
If the problem is lack of funds, use these levers to extend runway:
*   **Recalculate Expenses:** If you need to extend runway from 6 months to 12 months, you must cut the burn rate by 50% *immediately*.
*   **Choose the Cutting Method:**
    *   **Management Salary Cuts:** Use this first to demonstrate leadership and maintain team trust.
    *   **Equity Adjustments:** If you cannot pay full salaries, offer 5x the usual equity to employees to re-engage them in the mission.
    *   **Layoffs vs. Salary Reductions:** Prefer layoffs if the team is large/impersonal; prefer across-the-board salary reductions if the team is highly cohesive and mission-driven.
*   **Pay-to-Play Rounds:** If existing investors are hesitant, structure a down-round or a "pay-to-play" where investors must participate to avoid severe dilution.

## 4. Respond to a PMF Crisis (The Pivot Algorithm)
If your product is no longer relevant, evaluate a pivot using these five steps:
1.  **Validate the Problem:** Speak to users. Look for "pupil dilation" or strong emotional language (e.g., "I hate this"). If they say "I know someone with that problem," it’s not a valid pivot.
2.  **Assess Internal Assets:** Do you have technology, a specific team, or market know-how that gives you a "15% skill advantage" in a new direction?
3.  **Audit Energy:** Do you and the founders have the passion to go back to "Square One" for several years?
4.  **Validate with the Team:** Be transparent. Tell them "The old path is dead." If they don't buy into the new mission, you cannot pivot.
5.  **Re-pitch Investors:** Investors usually prefer a pivot over getting their money back. Present the pivot as a "new startup" with the advantage of an existing team and tech stack.

## 5. Lead Through the Crisis
*   **Radical Transparency:** Share the "essence" of the crisis. If 37 investors said no, tell the team "37 investors said no."
*   **Don't Sugarcoat:** If the situation is ugly, call it ugly. Hiding information causes top performers to leave first.
*   **Assume Full Responsibility:** Never blame the interest rates, the regulator, or the competitor. Responsibility equals control over your destiny.

## Examples

**Example 1: A Cash Crisis (WeSki during COVID)**
*   **Context:** All ski resorts closed globally; revenue dropped to zero.
*   **Application:** The founders assumed the crisis would last two seasons. They reduced the company to a "lean and small" core, implemented a "pay-to-play" funding round to force investor participation, and focused on product improvements.
*   **Output:** The company survived two years of zero revenue and emerged profitable when the market returned.

**Example 2: A PMF Crisis (Waze vs. Google Maps)**
*   **Context:** In 2010, Google announced free turn-by-turn navigation, threatening Waze's core value.
*   **Application:** Waze identified a different use case (daily commuters vs. occasional travelers). They doubled down on the "problem" of traffic jams rather than just "navigation." They raised bridge funding from Microsoft/Qualcomm by using FOMO (citing companies they *didn't* invest in).
*   **Output:** Waze maintained its niche and was eventually acquired by the competitor.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **The "Wait and See" Approach:** Waiting for "more data" before cutting costs. Every day you wait is a day of runway you can never get back.
*   **Cutting "Nickels and Dimes":** Trying to save the company by cutting office snacks or coffee. 75% of your costs are people; if you need to save the company, you must address payroll.
*   **Sugarcoating for the Board:** Downplaying the severity of a PMF shift to investors. They will eventually find out, and by then, you will have wasted their remaining capital.
*   **Losing the "A-Players":** If you aren't transparent during a crisis, your best people (who have the most options) will be the first to quit.
