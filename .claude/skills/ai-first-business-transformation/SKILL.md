# AI-First Business Transformation

This framework guides the transition from a traditional "late-stage" SaaS business to an aggressive, AI-agent-led organization. It focuses on disrupting your own legacy revenue models before competitors do, resetting culture for high-velocity execution, and aligning pricing with customer outcomes.

## Phase 1: Establish "Wartime" Leadership
Transition from a democratic, committee-based management style to a top-down, "founder mode" approach.

*   **Acknowledge the Crisis:** If net new ARR is falling or growth is plateauing, treat the situation as an existential threat.
*   **Take Unilateral Responsibility:** The CEO must make brave, hard decisions without waiting for consensus. Accept that if these decisions fail, the CEO is accountable.
*   **Pick One Lane:** Stop trying to be "all things to all people." Identify the one vertical where AI can provide the most value (e.g., Intercom narrowed its focus specifically to "Service").
*   **Cut Legacy Weight:** Aggressively cancel projects and fitting out expensive offices that don't support the AI-first mission.

## Phase 2: Cultural Reset (The "Sharp Knife")
Existing cultures built for stability often resist the high-velocity requirements of AI development. You must deliberately "restart" the culture.

*   **Rewrite Values:** Design values as a filter to keep high performers and remove those who don't fit. Include principles like "Resilience," "High Standards," and "Shareholder Value."
*   **Implement a Two-Factor Scorecard:** Grade employees quarterly on:
    1.  Performance against hard goals.
    2.  Behavior against new values.
*   **Automate Talent Departure:** Use a hard-coded formula where scoring below a certain mark leads to immediate departure. Accept high turnover (up to 40%) to build a highly aligned team.
*   **Empower "Young" Talent:** Hire and promote talent that is "vibe coding" and using AI by default in their workflows.

## Phase 3: Transition to Outcome-Based Pricing
Legacy SaaS pricing (per seat) is often misaligned with AI, which reduces the need for seats. Shift to charging for results.

*   **Identify the Value Unit:** Determine what the customer actually wants to achieve (e.g., a "Resolution" in customer support).
*   **Price Based on Value, Not Cost:** Do not price based on API costs or token usage. Price based on what the alternative (human labor) costs.
    *   *Intercom Example:* If a human resolution costs $20, charging $0.99 for an AI resolution is an easy sell, even if it initially costs the company more to provide.
*   **Simplify Ruthlessly:** Kill complex tiers, gates, and metrics. Move toward a "pay only when it works" model.
*   **Write Down Revenue:** Be willing to lose short-term ARR by letting customers move off expensive, legacy seat-based plans to fairer, simpler AI pricing.

## Phase 4: AI Operational Principles
Change how the organization actually builds product.

*   **Prototypes over Planning:** Aim for a working AI prototype within weeks (Intercom built the Fin prototype in 6 weeks).
*   **AI-Native Workflows:** Mandate the use of AI tools for non-technical roles (writing job descriptions, aggregating content, basic coding).
*   **Hire Specialists:** You cannot "AI-wash" a legacy engineering team. You must bring in actual AI scientists and leaders.

## Examples

**Example 1: Pricing Model Shift**
*   **Context:** A B2B SaaS company for legal document review sees users spending less time in the app because AI is doing the work.
*   **Input:** Current pricing is $100/month per lawyer.
*   **Application:** Transition to "Per Contract Reviewed." Calculate the average time a lawyer saves per contract (e.g., 2 hours). If a lawyer’s time is $200/hr, charge $50 per AI-reviewed contract.
*   **Output:** Revenue scales with AI efficiency rather than human headcount.

**Example 2: Cultural Performance Review**
*   **Context:** An engineering lead is high-performing but complains constantly in Slack about the "top-down" direction of the AI pivot.
*   **Input:** Performance Score: 5/5. Behavior Score: 1/5.
*   **Application:** Apply the values scorecard. Despite the high performance, the behavior score brings the average below the retention threshold.
*   **Output:** The employee is let go to preserve the "wartime" alignment of the remaining team.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Democratic "Poll-Based" Decision Making:** In a pivot, asking everyone for their opinion leads to diluted strategy. The CEO must drive the direction.
*   **The "AI Sprinkle":** Adding a thin layer of AI (like a basic chatbot) onto a legacy product without changing the core business model or pricing.
*   **Fear of Revenue Cannibalization:** Refusing to launch a better AI product because it might replace a high-margin legacy human-service business. You must disrupt yourself before someone else does.
*   **Hiring "Stable" over "Founder-Type" Employees:** AI-first pivots require people who are comfortable with mess, speed, and 12-hour days. Standard "corporate" hires will struggle.
