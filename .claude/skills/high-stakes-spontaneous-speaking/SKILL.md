description: Techniques to project executive presence and master on-the-spot communication. Use this when you are nervous before a presentation, need to answer difficult questions in a meeting, or are preparing a high-stakes talk without time to memorize a script.
---

The goal of effective speaking is to move from a conscious, overthinking state into a subconscious flow state. By focusing on root behaviors—intensity, presence, and recovery—you can project confidence even when you feel internal turbulence.

## Core Mindset: The Professional "Stay in Character"
Internal nervousness is invisible to your audience unless you "leak" it. 
- **Do not break character:** Avoid apologizing for a "bad" answer, laughing nervously after a mistake, or saying "I hope that made sense."
- **Stay in it:** Even if you feel you are rambling or failing, maintain a confident posture and tone. Your audience will perceive you as confident by default unless you tell them otherwise.
- **Think Up:** When gathering your thoughts, look up and to the right rather than down at the floor or your lap. Looking up makes you appear thoughtful and confident; looking down makes you appear uncertain or distracted.

## The Accordion Method for Presentation Prep
Instead of writing a script (which leads to "robotic" delivery and memory failures), build your talk through speaking to internalize the content.

1.  **The Three-Minute Dump:** Speak your entire talk for 3 minutes. Do not stop for mistakes. Focus on getting the core ideas out.
2.  **The Two-Minute Shave:** Give the same talk in 2 minutes. This forces you to cut the "noise" and keep only the most important points.
3.  **The 30-Second Essence:** Give the talk in 30 seconds. This identifies your "Arrow"—the one single thing you want the audience to remember.
4.  **The Expansion (Back to 3 Minutes):** Now, give the talk for 3 minutes again. Having found the essence, you will feel you have a "football field" of space to add back only the most impactful stories or data points.

## Spontaneous Performance Tactics

### Land the Plane (End Strong)
Most speakers taper off at the end because they regain self-consciousness. Anticipate this "finish line" effect and use a **Summary Prompt** to force a strong finish:
- "To wrap up..."
- "My point here is..."
- "The one thing to remember is..."

### The Bow and Arrow
Every communication should have one "Arrow" (the core message).
- **The Arrow:** A single sentence the audience should remember.
- **The Bow:** The tension/weight that makes the arrow fly. This is your supporting data, a vivid anecdote, or a personal story.
- **Application:** For every slide or meeting contribution, ask: "What is my Arrow here?" If you can't name it, don't speak yet.

### Conviction Prompts
If you struggle with "Executive Presence," force your brain into a state of conviction by starting sentences with high-stakes phrases. Your brain will naturally fill in the gap with more authoritative content.
- "In fact..."
- "I genuinely believe that..."
- "It astonishes me when..."

## Examples

**Example 1: Navigating a "Stump" Question in a Meeting**
- **Context:** A stakeholder asks a difficult question about a project delay you weren't fully prepared to answer.
- **Input:** "Why is the API integration two weeks behind schedule?"
- **Application:** 
    1. **Think Up:** Look up to the right for 2 seconds to gather the "Arrow."
    2. **Stay in Character:** Do not say "Sorry, I wasn't expecting that."
    3. **Conviction Prompt:** Start with "The core reality is..."
- **Output:** (Looking up thoughtfully) "The core reality is that we prioritized security audits over raw speed. While it's two weeks behind, it prevents a major vulnerability. To wrap up: we are on track for a secure launch by Friday."

**Example 2: Preparing an All-Hands Segment**
- **Context:** You have 5 minutes to present the new product roadmap.
- **Application:**
    1. Run the **Accordion Method**. Discover that the 30-second version is: "We are moving from a features-first to a platform-first company."
    2. Identify the **Bow**: A story about a customer who couldn't use a specific feature because the platform was too rigid.
    3. During the talk, use the **Arrow** as your slide title.
- **Output:** A talk that feels conversational and "internalized" rather than read from notes.

## Common Pitfalls
- **The "Safety" Trap:** Being monotonous to avoid mistakes. *Correction:* Allow your energy to fluctuate; use higher intensity for important points and lower intensity for reflections.
- **The Script Crutch:** Memorizing words instead of ideas. *Correction:* If you forget a word in a script, you crash. If you internalize a "pillar," you can always find your way back.
- **Leaking Insecurity:** Explicitly stating that you are nervous or that your answer was poor. *Correction:* Trust that the audience cannot see your internal state; if you don't mention the "turbulence," they won't notice it.
