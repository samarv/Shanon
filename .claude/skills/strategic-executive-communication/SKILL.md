description: Master the art of influential communication by leading with "sales" (the why) before "logistics" (the how), using signposting for clarity, and proactively addressing the Most Obvious Objection (MOO). Use this when seeking buy-in for a proposal, sending complex Slack updates to cross-functional teams, or preparing for high-stakes executive reviews.

# Strategic Executive Communication

Communication is not just about sharing information; it is a means to an end. The goal is to move the needle, get buy-in, and drive action. By taking ownership of the "blast radius" of your messages, you can reduce back-and-forth, eliminate apathy, and increase the likelihood of getting what you want.

## Core Principles

### 1. Sales, then Logistics
Never jump straight into the "how" before securing agreement on the "why." 
- **Sales Note:** Designed to get people excited and secure agreement.
- **Logistics Note:** Details the process, timeline, and execution.
- **Order of Operations:** If you share logistics before the audience has bought into the vision, they will view the task as a burden rather than an opportunity.

### 2. The MOO (Most Obvious Objection)
Before sending any message or starting a meeting, spend two minutes identifying the "Most Obvious Objection." 
- Anticipate the skepticism your audience will likely have.
- Address the objection proactively within your pitch or memo.
- If you don't know the answer, acknowledge it accurately rather than guessing.

### 3. Concision over Brevity
Concision is about the density of insight, not absolute word count. A 1,000-word memo can be concise if every sentence is high-leverage.
- **Find the "Chase":** You cannot "cut to the chase" if you haven't identified what the core point is. 
- **Reduce Cognitive Load:** Edit your work at least once to trim secondary information. Move "nice-to-know" details into a Slack thread or an appendix.

## Implementation Workflow

### Step 1: Frame the Conversation
Start every meeting or long memo with a 30-second "Sales" frame.
- **Context:** "Two weeks ago, we noticed [Problem]..."
- **Action:** "I’ve drafted a fix for [Area]..."
- **Input Needed:** "What I need from you today is feedback on [X] and a decision on [Y]."

### 2. Use Signposting Power Words
Guide the reader's eye and signal the structure of your logic using specific "Signposting" words:
- **"For example":** Signals an illustrative proof point.
- **"Because":** Signals the rationale and logic behind a decision.
- **"As a next step":** Signals clear ownership and action.
- **"First, Second, Third":** Creates structural hierarchy without needing complex formatting.

### 3. Calibrate Confidence
Speak accurately about your level of conviction to build long-term trust.
- **Avoid:** "This will increase revenue by 20%." (Stating hypotheses as fact).
- **Use:** "Based on our initial hunch and [Data Point], we believe this has the highest likelihood of increasing revenue."
- **Avoid "The Martyr":** Don't ignore company context. If the CEO's goal is retention, don't pitch a growth project without explaining how it supports retention.

## Examples

### Example 1: Requesting Team Input
**Context:** A Head of Ops needs executives to fill out a "Wins" spreadsheet.
**Ineffective (Logistics first):** "Please fill out the Wins sheet by Friday at 5 PM. Use the specific format in Column B and link to the Notion doc."
**Effective (Sales first):** "We want to shine a light on the amazing work your teams are doing so the whole company sees their impact. This is a great way to boost morale. To make this happen, please drop 2-3 wins into this doc by Friday. I've simplified the format so it takes less than 2 minutes."

### Example 2: Addressing the MOO in a Proposal
**Context:** Pitching a new software tool that costs $50k.
**The MOO:** "We already spent our budget for the quarter."
**The Application:** Start the proposal by saying: "I know our department budget is currently locked for Q3. However, I’ve identified a way this tool can save us $70k in manual labor costs starting next month, effectively making it budget-neutral within 60 days. Because of this ROI, I recommend we pull forward the investment."

## Common Pitfalls
- **Venting as Feedback:** Using a feedback session for "self-expression" rather than "strategy." If your goal is behavior change, delete anything that just makes you feel better but makes the recipient defensive.
- **The Formatting Trap:** Bolding more than 10% of a document. If everything is bolded, nothing is highlighted.
- **The "I'll Get Back to You" Default:** When asked a question you don't know, don't just shut down. Provide the "Question behind the Question" (e.g., "I don't have the exact mobile login % for June, but the trend has been 60-70% all quarter. Are you concerned about our mobile investment?")
- **Assuming Buy-In:** Presuming that because someone agreed two weeks ago, they are still "sold" today. Always re-sell the "why" briefly.
