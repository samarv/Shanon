name: eigenquestion-product-assessment
description: Evaluates a candidate's ability to identify the 1-2 fundamental variables (Eigenquestions) that dictate a product's strategy. Use this during interviews for PM, engineering, or leadership roles to test first-principles thinking, strategic clarity, and the ability to reduce complexity in ambiguous, low-stakes environments.

The Eigenquestion Assessment is a "coded" test that separates candidates who get bogged down in details from those who can identify the core drivers of a business. By using a hypothetical scenario, you remove domain bias and force the candidate to demonstrate their mental model for decision-making.

## The Process

### 1. The Setup
Present a low-stakes, high-impact hypothetical scenario. The goal is to provide a blank slate with infinite possibilities.
- **The Prompt:** "A group of scientists has invented a teleportation device. They’ve hired you to be their business counterpart to bring this to market. What do you do?"
- **The Observation Phase:** Allow the candidate to ask initial clarifying questions. They will likely ask about range, safety, size, or power requirements. Do not provide detailed answers; keep them brief.

### 2. The Constraint (The Pivot)
Once the candidate has generated a list of questions, introduce a hard constraint to force prioritization.
- **The Pivot:** "The scientists are annoyed by your questions. They will only answer **two** of your questions. After that, they expect a full strategic plan. What two questions do you ask?"

### 3. Identifying the Eigenquestions
An Eigenquestion is a question where the answer provides the answer to many other questions. Evaluate if the candidate's chosen questions allow them to create a decision matrix or quadrants.
- **Good Eigenquestions:** Address existential risks (safety) or business models (cost structure).
- **Weak Questions:** Address cosmetic or incremental details (color, size, branding) that don't fundamentally change the product's "class" or target market.

### 4. The Strategy Map
Require the candidate to explain how the answers to their two questions would change their go-to-market plan. They should be able to describe at least two distinct paths based on the variables they chose.

## Examples of Application

### Example 1: The Teleportation Device
**Context:** Evaluating a Senior PM for strategic depth.
**The Two Questions:** 
1. Is it safe for humans?
2. Is it expensive to build (CapEx) or expensive to run (OpEx)?
**The Application:**
- **Scenario A (Safe + Cheap to build/Expensive to run):** Deploy "human fax machines" everywhere. High accessibility, pay-per-use model.
- **Scenario B (Safe + Expensive to build/Cheap to run):** Build major hubs. Replace airports and long-distance rail.
- **Scenario C (Not safe for humans):** Pivot to high-value cargo, organ transport, or hazardous waste disposal.

### Example 2: The Physical Retail Placement
**Context:** Evaluating a Growth Lead's understanding of market saturation.
**The Scenario:** "There are three gas stations on the same street corner. You are tasked with opening a fourth. What do you do?"
**The Eigenquestion:** "Is the customer's primary driver convenience of location or price sensitivity for this specific route?"
**The Application:**
- If **Location**: Analyze traffic flow patterns (right-turn vs. left-turn access) to capture a different "segment" of the same intersection.
- If **Price**: Analyze the supply chain/loyalty program depth to see if you can undercut the existing three on margin.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Accepting "Interesting" over "Useful":** Candidates often ask "interesting" questions (e.g., "How does it work?") that don't help them make a business decision. **The Fix:** Always ask, "What decision would the answer to that question allow you to make?"
- **Providing Too Much Data Early:** If you answer every initial question, the candidate never has to prioritize. **The Fix:** Remain vague until you move to the "Two Question" constraint.
- **Ignoring the Strategy Map:** A candidate might pick two good questions but fail to explain how the answers dictate different paths. **The Fix:** Force them to build a 2x2 matrix or a set of "if/then" scenarios based on their questions.
- **Focusing on "Right" Answers:** There is no single correct Eigenquestion. The goal is to see if the candidate's questions are *structurally* sound and lead to a structured path forward.
