# Social Radar Founder Evaluation

The "Social Radar" is a methodology for identifying high-potential founders by observing social cues, behavioral patterns, and interpersonal dynamics that technical metrics often miss. At the earliest stages of a company, the character and resilience of the founders are more predictive of success than the initial idea.

## Core Principles

### 1. Evaluate Earnestness over Charisma
Charisma can be faked; earnestness cannot. Earnestness is a combination of authenticity and a deep-seated obsession with the problem.
*   **The "Phony" Test:** Distinguish between those starting a company because it is "cool" and those who are genuinely fixing a broken industry they understand.
*   **Humble Confidence:** Look for founders who can say "I don't know the answer to that yet, but here is how I will find out" rather than those who use smoke and mirrors to avoid questions.

### 2. Look for "Relentless Resourcefulness"
Determine if the founders are "cockroaches" who can survive on nothing and make things happen through sheer willpower.
*   **The Scrappy Proxy:** Look for evidence of extreme lengths taken to keep the project alive (e.g., the Airbnb "Obama O’s" cereal box strategy).
*   **Making Shit Happen:** Prioritize founders who exhibit a history of "hustling" over those who wait for permission or perfect conditions.

### 3. Assess the "Flexible Mind"
The first idea is rarely the final one. A founder must be able to pivot without losing momentum.
*   **The Tennis Match:** A good interview should feel like a high-energy tennis match—a back-and-forth exchange of ideas.
*   **Zero Defensiveness:** If a founder becomes defensive when their idea is challenged, they are likely not open-minded enough to listen to their users or pivot when the market demands it.

## The Observation Checklist

During a 10-minute high-intensity interaction, look for these specific behavioral markers:

### Team Dynamics (The "Co-founder Connection")
*   **History:** Do they have a long-term relationship (school, previous work)? Founders who "met to start a startup" are a high risk for breakup.
*   **Communication:** Do they finish each other's sentences, or do they interrupt and contradict each other?
*   **The "Hacker in a Cage" Flag:** Watch for a "business" founder who dominates the conversation while the technical founder sits silently. The technical lead must have an opinion on the product direction.
*   **Equity Balance:** Large gaps in equity (e.g., 99% vs 1%) are red flags for future resentment and power imbalances.

### Commitment Levels
*   **"Burning the Boats":** Are they ready to quit their jobs? Founders who keep a "safety net" at a big tech company often quit when the startup gets difficult.
*   **Desperation as Fuel:** Look for a "need" to succeed rather than a "want."

### Domain Expertise
*   **User Connection:** Are they solving their own problem?
*   **Broken Industry Knowledge:** Can they articulate exactly why a specific industry is broken in a way an outsider couldn't?

## Implementation Guide

### Strategic Questions to Trigger "Social Radar" Cues:
1.  "How exactly did you two meet, and how long have you worked together?" (Tests history)
2.  "Why are you working on *this* specifically instead of any other idea?" (Tests earnestness)
3.  "What is a specific time you had to do something 'unscalable' or 'scrappy' to get a user?" (Tests resourcefulness)
4.  "If [Competitor X] launched a version of this tomorrow for free, what would you do?" (Tests defensiveness and flexibility)

## Examples

**Example 1: The Scrappy Hustler**
*   **Context:** Evaluating an early-stage team with a questionable idea.
*   **Input:** The founders explain they funded their initial runway by hand-gluing custom cereal boxes to sell as collector's items.
*   **Social Radar Observation:** They aren't just "talking" about being founders; they are willing to do humiliating or tedious work to survive.
*   **Decision:** High-conviction "Yes" based on character, regardless of the current pivot state.

**Example 2: The "Phony" Narrative**
*   **Context:** A team of experienced professionals pitching a trendy consumer app.
*   **Input:** A group of 45-year-old executives pitching a fashion app for teenagers because "the market is huge."
*   **Social Radar Observation:** When asked about their connection to the users, they cite "market data" but have no personal connection or "earnest" interest in teen fashion.
*   **Decision:** "No." The lack of authenticity means they will likely quit when the market doesn't provide "easy money."

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Falling for "The Suit":** Over-valuing polished, charismatic presenters who lack the "scrappy" dna required for the early-stage grind.
*   **Ignoring the "Dinner Test":** If you wouldn't want to have dinner with the founders once a week, you likely shouldn't fund them. Life is too short to work with "assholes," even brilliant ones.
*   **Dismissing the Quiet Founder:** The less-vocal founder (often the technical lead) may be the engine of the company. Ensure you engage them directly to see if they are a "hacker in a cage" or a true partner.
*   **Underestimating Defensiveness:** Mistaking "passion for an idea" for "defensiveness." If they can't take feedback in an interview, they won't take feedback from the market.
