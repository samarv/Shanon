description: A tactical framework for conducting individual terminations or large-scale layoffs with dignity. Use this when a team member is no longer a fit, or when fiscal constraints require a reduction in force (RIF).

## Overview
Learning to fire people humanely is one of the most important skills for any leader. A successful termination process prevents dehumanization, protects the company’s reputation, and actually improves the performance of the remaining team. The core principle is to separate the **Decision** (based on business/customer needs) from the **Implementation** (focused on compassion for the human).

## The Wei Deng Framework
Before acting, separate your logic from your emotions:
1.  **The Decision:** Solve for the customer. Would the customer want this person in the role? If the answer is "no," the decision is made.
2.  **The Implementation:** Solve for the person being hurt. Identify what the departing employee, yourself, and the team need to recover and move forward.

## Process: Individual Termination
When letting a single employee go, follow these three steps:

### 1. The Pre-Arrival Warning
Surprise triggers the amygdala, causing anger and "gripped" thinking. Give the person a few seconds to mentally prepare.
*   **Action:** Start the meeting by saying: "This is going to be a difficult conversation. I want you to take a few seconds and prepare yourself. You are not going to enjoy this. Are you ready?"

### 2. The Delivery
Deliver the news clearly and concisely.
*   **Action:** "I am letting you go. Here is why: [1-2 sentences of context]."
*   **Active Listening:** Allow them to release emotions. Ask: "I imagine you are feeling anger, fear, or sadness. Would you be willing to share what you’re feeling?"
*   **Reflect back:** Repeat their feelings until they feel heard. Use "I statements" like: "I perceive you are feeling that this is irresponsible of the company. Is that right?"

### 3. Become Their "Agent"
Instead of offering a passive reference, become an active agent (like a talent agent) to help them find their next role.
*   **Action:** Schedule a follow-up meeting for 1 hour the next day.
*   **Goal:** Help them identify what they are passionate about and what they are uniquely good at.
*   **The Outreach:** Personally reach out to 2–3 specific founders or hiring managers in your network to recommend them for roles that fit their genius.

## Process: Large-Scale Layoffs (RIF)
To ensure a layoff improves company performance rather than destroying it, follow this 24-hour sequence:

### 1. The Selection (48 Hours Prior)
*   Give managers a **dollar amount** to cut, not a headcount. (Cutting by headcount often leads to firing junior staff who do the most work).
*   Let the direct manager choose who is cut; do not have executives choose for teams they don't manage.

### 2. The Morning: The Delivery
*   **Rule:** Every person must hear the news from their direct manager in a 1-on-1. 
*   **Never** use group emails, Slack announcements, or large Zoom calls to deliver the news. It is dehumanizing and prevents emotional release.

### 3. The Afternoon: The "Stay Team" All-Hands
*   Gather the remaining team. 
*   State clearly: "We cut deep so we only have to cut once. You are the 'Stay Team.' We are building the future with you."
*   Address fear: Explain why the company is safe and why these cuts ensure survival for the next 3 years.

### 4. The Following Week: Recovery
*   Managers must have a 1-hour 1-on-1 with every member of the "Stay Team."
*   The sole agenda is "How are you feeling?"
*   Reflect their feelings (sadness for lost friends, anger at the company) to reduce emotional friction by ~25%, allowing them to return to work faster.

## Examples

**Example 1: Individual Performance Issue**
*   **Context:** A marketing manager is hitting 70% of targets and lacks the technical skills for the upcoming scale.
*   **Application:** Manager uses the "Difficult Conversation" script. During the "Agent" phase, the manager realizes the employee loves small-scale brand storytelling.
*   **Output:** The Manager emails three early-stage founders saying, "I just let X go because we needed a growth engineer, but they are the best storyteller I've met. You should hire them today."

**Example 2: Company-wide 20% RIF**
*   **Context:** Tech valuations dropped; the company needs to extend runway from 6 months to 36 months.
*   **Application:** CEOs give VPs a budget reduction target. On Tuesday morning, every impacted employee has a 15-minute 1-on-1 with their manager. On Tuesday afternoon, the CEO holds an all-hands.
*   **Output:** By Wednesday, every manager is conducting "How are you feeling?" sessions. The company sees an absolute increase in feature output within 2 weeks due to reduced coordination overhead.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Emailing the News:** This is the #1 reason for "botched" layoffs. It feels dehumanizing and causes people to go to the press/social media. Always do it 1-on-1.
*   **Cutting Too Shallow:** Doing multiple small rounds of layoffs ("death by a thousand cuts") creates organizational PTSD. Cut deep enough that you can honestly tell the remaining team they are safe.
*   **Skipping the "Stay Team" 1-on-1s:** If you ignore the emotions of the people who remain, they will feel "survivor's guilt" or fear, leading to quiet quitting or mass resignations.
*   **Passive References:** Saying "I'll give you a reference if you need one" is useless. Being an **active agent** is what preserves the relationship and the person's dignity.
