name: foundation-sprint-framework
description: A 10-hour, 3-phase strategic framework to align a core team and define a product's unique promise before building. Use it when starting a new venture, launching a high-risk feature, or when a team lacks alignment on target customers and differentiation.
---

The Foundation Sprint is a "missing manual" for the early stages of product development. It replaces months of circular debate with a structured, 10-hour process (typically two 5-hour days) to create a testable "Founding Hypothesis."

## Prerequisites
- **The Team:** 2–7 core people (Founders, PM, Lead Designer, Lead Engineer).
- **The Decider:** One person (CEO or Head of Product) who makes the final call on stalemates.
- **The Rules:** Clear calendars. No Slack, no email, no meetings. Use "Work Alone Together"—individuals write ideas in silence before voting.

## Phase 1: The Basics (Hours 1–4)
Define the essential elements of the project using the "Note and Vote" tactic.

### 1. Identify the Core Elements
Answer these four questions specifically:
- **The Customer:** Who is the *single* most important person to please? (e.g., "Artisans who sell jewelry online but find marketing hard").
- **The Problem:** What is their primary pain point? (e.g., "Stagnant sales growth outside of local craft fairs").
- **The Competition/Alternatives:** How are they solving it today? (e.g., Shopify, Etsy, Instagram DMs, or doing nothing).
- **The Advantage:** What special capability do you have? (e.g., "We built the recommendation engine for Substack").

## Phase 2: Differentiation (Hours 4–7)
Identify the unique promise that will make customers switch from their current solution.

### 1. Score Classic Differentiators
Rate your idea against competitors on a scale for these "Classics":
- Fast vs. Slow
- Smart vs. Not so smart
- Easy vs. Hard to use
- Free vs. Expensive
- Focused vs. One-size-fits-all
- Simple vs. Complicated
- Integrated vs. Siloed

### 2. Map the "Loserville" 2x2
Create a chart with your two strongest differentiators as the X and Y axes.
- **Goal:** Plot your product in the top-right quadrant.
- **Loserville:** All competitors should fall into an "L" shape across the other three quadrants.
- **Example:** For a newsletter tool, axes might be "Networked" and "Low Effort."

### 3. Create Project Principles
Draft 3–5 "Mini-Manifesto" rules to guide future decisions.
- **Example:** "Help sellers help each other" or "Fast is better than slow."

## Phase 3: The Approach (Hours 7–10)
Evaluate implementation paths using "Magic Lenses."

### 1. List 3–4 Approaches
Define different ways to solve the problem (e.g., "A Shopify Plugin," "A standalone mobile app," "A full-stack marketplace").

### 2. Filter through Magic Lenses
Plot each approach on a 2x2 grid using these lenses to see which wins:
- **Customer Lens:** Which is the perfect solution for their pain?
- **Pragmatic Lens:** Which is cheapest and fastest to build?
- **Growth Lens:** Which is easiest for users to adopt?
- **Conviction Lens:** Which one are the founders most "F*** yeah" about?

## The Output: The Founding Hypothesis
Combine all findings into a single Mad Libs sentence:

> "If we help **[Customer]** solve **[Problem]** with **[Approach]** (backup: **[Backup Plan]**), we believe they will choose it over **[Competitors]** because our solution is **[Differentiator 1]** and **[Differentiator 2]**."

## Examples

**Example 1: Artisans Platform (Latchet)**
- **Customer:** Jewelry makers/painters who find tech marketing difficult.
- **Problem:** Need sales growth but Etsy is too commoditized.
- **Approach:** A social-sales mobile app.
- **Differentiation:** "Cooperative" and "Helps you grow."
- **Hypothesis:** If we help Artisans solve sales growth with a social sales app, they will choose it over Shopify because we are cooperative and easy to use.

**Example 2: AI Productivity Tool (Mellow)**
- **Customer:** Busy professionals overwhelmed by admin tasks.
- **Problem:** Generic AI over-promises and under-delivers.
- **Approach:** Mobile-first specialized AI agents.
- **Differentiation:** "Works out of the box" and "Human-centric."
- **Hypothesis:** If we help professionals solve tedious admin with specialized agents, they will choose us over OpenAI because we work out of the box and feel personal.

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Outsourcing the Thinking to AI:** Using AI to generate the strategy leads to generic, undifferentiated products. Use AI for *prototyping*, but humans must define the *differentiation*.
2. **Skipping the Decider:** Without a designated Decider, the 10 hours will devolve into circular consensus-seeking.
3. **The "Everything" Trap:** Scoring yourself as "better" than competitors on every scale. You must choose 1-2 specific ways to win and be "okay" with being average at the rest.
4. **Drafting in Isolation:** Failing to include the Lead Engineer in the "Magic Lenses" phase, leading to an approach that is technically impossible or takes too long.
