# Navigating Difficult Performance Conversations

A structured approach to delivering hard feedback and news while maintaining a professional relationship. The goal of these conversations is not to make employees "happy," but to provide the clarity and results-oriented guidance necessary for their long-term career success.

## Core Mindset: The "Helper" Perspective
Before starting the meeting, shift your mindset from "I am hurting this person" to "I am giving them the opportunity to see something differently so they can improve." If you don't speak up, you deny them the chance to change their career trajectory.

## The Script Frameworks

### 1. Constructive Performance Feedback
Focus on "observable facts" rather than judgments.
- **The Hook:** "I wanted to have a conversation with you about some things I’ve been hearing/observing regarding [Specific Area]."
- **The Data:** "What I’m hearing/observing is [Fact 1] and [Fact 2]. For example, [Specific instance]."
- **The Shared Goal:** "We both know that the most important way you can be successful here is to [Expected Behavior]."
- **The Close:** "I want to hear what you have to say, but we need to leave this discussion knowing exactly how you will [Target Outcome]."

### 2. The "No Promotion" Conversation
Be upfront immediately; do not "bury the lead."
- **The News:** "I know this is going to be challenging for you to hear, and I know you were hoping for this promotion, but we are not going to promote you at this time."
- **The "Why" (Strategic Context):** "In discussing this with my peers, we've identified we need [Specific Skill/Experience] for this role that you haven't demonstrated yet."
- **The Hope:** "It is really important to me that you succeed here. I want to help you find opportunities to build these specific skills so you can advance in the future."
- **The Allyship:** "I am committed to helping you build those skills."

### 3. The Pre-Firing Warning (The "Crystal Clear" Talk)
Use this when previous feedback has been ignored and the relationship is at risk.
- **The Alert:** "We have to have a difficult conversation. I’ve talked to you multiple times about [Issue]."
- **The Reality Check:** "After [Time Period], I continue to see [Issue]. I need you to know this is a deal breaker."
- **The Ultimatum:** "I need you to fix this within the next 30 days. Otherwise, we are going to have to find a way to part ways. I know you have it in you to change, but if you don't, we won't have a future together."

## Handling Defensiveness and Emotions
If the report gets heated, begins to cry, or enters a cycle of "Yes I did/No you didn't," use the **Strategic Pause**.

1. **Acknowledge:** "Let’s pause for a second. I can see that the energy has changed and you’re getting a little bit heated/upset."
2. **Reiterate Intent:** "I want you to know I have no intention of upsetting you. I am telling you this because I want to help you in your career."
3. **Offer Space:** "I understand you might need a moment to digest this. Do we continue now, or should we pause and come back to this tomorrow?"

## Examples

**Example 1: Specific Skill Feedback (Writing)**
- **Context:** A Senior PM's PRDs are disorganized.
- **Input:** The PM thinks they are doing great because they hit deadlines.
- **Application:** "I appreciate that you hit your deadlines. However, I've observed that your documents lack clear structure and a conclusion. Since the level of your writing reflects the level of your thinking to the rest of the org, I’d like you to model your next three PRDs after [Example PM]'s templates."
- **Output:** The PM understands the specific delta between "done" and "excellent."

**Example 2: Managing a Defensive Reaction**
- **Context:** You tell a report they missed a deadline, and they immediately blame another team.
- **Input:** Report says, "It's not my fault, Design was late!"
- **Application:** "I hear that Design was late. However, the feedback is that you didn't flag that delay to the stakeholders until after the deadline had passed. Let's pause—I'm not trying to blame you, I'm trying to help you manage stakeholder expectations so you don't lose their trust. Can we talk about how to flag those blockers earlier?"
- **Output:** Shift from a "blame" mindset to a "problem-solving" mindset.

## Common Pitfalls
- **The "Nice" Trap:** Shying away from feedback because you "don't want to make them sad." This is actually unkind, as it allows them to fail without knowing why.
- **Vague Evidence:** Saying "People think you're hard to work with." Instead, use: "I have observed three instances where your peers felt they weren't kept in the loop on a decision."
- **Arguing over Feelings:** If someone says "I don't think I was defensive," don't argue. Say: "I understand you see it differently. My observation is that the collaboration is currently strained, and we need to fix that."
- **Lack of Hope:** Giving the "No Promotion" news without a path forward. Always end with how they can get to a "Yes" next time.
