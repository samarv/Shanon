name: curiosity-led-disagreement
description: A framework for handling intense professional disagreements by leading with curiosity rather than defense. Use this when a colleague proposes a "crazy wrong" idea, when you feel a visceral "no" reaction in a high-stakes meeting, or when you need to bridge a profound schism in perspectives to reach the best outcome.
---

## Overview
Disagreements often trigger a "lizard brain" response: the need to protect your ego and prove you are right. This skill redirects that energy into radical curiosity. By assuming the other person has unique information you lack, you can tear down walls and reach a superior "global optimum" decision.

## The Process

### 1. Execute "The Pause"
When you hear an idea that feels "crazy wrong," your body will have a primal, protective reaction. 
- Stop talking immediately.
- Take a breath to allow your body to calm down.
- Reinterpret the visceral "no" feeling not as a threat, but as a signal that there is a data gap to be filled.

### 2. Sublimate the Ego
Shift your internal goal from "being right" to "getting to the right outcome."
- Remind yourself: "It is impossible for me to know everything."
- Adopt the "Fascinating" mindset: Truly believe that it is fascinating that two smart people can look at the same facts and reach different conclusions.

### 3. Deploy the Ami Vora Pivot
Use a specific script to open the door to their perspective without conceding your own yet.
- **The Script:** "Fascinating. You have to tell me more about why you think that."
- **The Tone:** The delivery must be genuinely curious, not dismissive or sarcastic. You are hunting for the "hidden facts" they possess.

### 4. Uncover the Narrative
Use specific questions to find the root of the disagreement:
- "What unique information do you have that I might be missing?"
- "How are you interpreting the facts we both see?"
- "What would have to be true for this to be the right path?"

### 5. Load a "Leadership Emulator"
If you are still stuck, mentally simulate how a trusted leader would handle the disagreement.
- "How would [Leader Name] describe this problem?"
- "What principle would they use to break this tie?"
- This provides a fresh lens and helps you step out of your own emotional bias.

## Examples

**Example 1: High-Stakes Product Strategy**
*   **Context:** A Growth Lead suggests cutting a core feature to simplify the onboarding flow. You believe this will alienate power users.
*   **Input:** You feel an immediate urge to list all the reasons they are wrong.
*   **Application:** You pause and say, "Fascinating. Tell me more about what you're seeing in the data that makes that trade-off worth it."
*   **Output:** You discover the Growth Lead has data showing 80% of churn happens because users are overwhelmed by that specific feature. You both agree to a "soft-hide" version of the feature instead of a full cut.

**Example 2: Cross-Functional Goal Tension**
*   **Context:** The Engineering Lead says a deadline is impossible unless you cut the scope of the "Dolores Park" (warm/intimate) feel of the UI.
*   **Input:** You are frustrated because the "feel" is the core of the product metaphor.
*   **Application:** You ask, "Fascinating. Which specific parts of the UI iconography are adding the most complexity? I want to understand the trade-offs you're making."
*   **Output:** You realize the "strobe light" effects are the bottleneck. You agree to keep the warm color palette (the feeling) while cutting the complex animations (the technical debt).

## Common Pitfalls
- **Weaponized Curiosity:** Using the word "Fascinating" as a code for "You're an idiot." If your team learns that "Fascinating" means "I disagree," you must change your vocabulary (use a thesaurus) to maintain genuine openness.
- **Skipping the Recommendation:** Curiosity is for gathering info, but as a PM, you still "own the recommendation." Don't let curiosity lead to indecision. Once you have the info, make the call.
- **The "Toddler Soccer" Error:** Trying to solve a disagreement by everyone running to the same metric. If the disagreement is about *how* to move the metric, refer back to the higher-level "global optimum" (the mountain summit) rather than the "local optimum" (your current hill).
- **Shrinking Yourself:** Do not confuse being "likable" or "curious" with having no opinion. You must have a strong opinion, but be willing to hold it loosely in the face of new information.
