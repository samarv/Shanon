description: A four-step system to reclaim attention by managing internal discomfort and scheduling intentions. Use this when procrastinating on "hard" work (like PRDs or strategy), reflexively checking Slack/email, or failing to meet personal output goals.

The Indistractable Focus Framework treats distraction not as a technological problem, but as an emotional regulation problem. It shifts your focus from "checking off boxes" on a to-do list to "protecting time" for traction—any action that moves you toward your values.

## Phase 1: Master Internal Triggers
90% of distractions are caused by an internal desire to escape discomfort (boredom, anxiety, or fatigue). You must manage the "itch" before you can focus.

*   **Apply the 10-Minute Rule**: When you feel the urge to check email or social media while doing deep work, tell yourself "Not yet." Set a timer for 10 minutes. During those 10 minutes, you must either:
    1.  Return to the task at hand.
    2.  "Surf the urge" by sitting with the uncomfortable feeling and breathing until it subsides.
*   **Reframe the Sensation**: Use the mantra: *"This is what it feels like to get better."* Acknowledge that the "cold start" of a hard task is naturally uncomfortable.
*   **Reject "Ego Depletion"**: Stop believing willpower is a limited resource. Research shows that willpower only "runs out" if you believe it does. Treat your focus as an infinite capacity you simply need to direct.

## Phase 2: Make Time for Traction
You cannot call something a distraction unless you know what it distracted you from. Replace to-do lists with a "Time Boxed" calendar.

*   **Build a Time Boxed Calendar**: Every Sunday, spend 10 minutes assigning every minute of your work day to a specific task.
    *   **Include "Reflective Work"**: Block 1-2 hours for thinking, strategy, and planning without interruptions.
    *   **Include "Reactive Work"**: Specifically block time for Slack and email so they don't bleed into deep work.
*   **Perform a "Schedule Sync"**: Every Monday morning, show your calendar to your manager.
    *   **The Script**: "Here is what I have planned for the week and how I’m prioritizing my time. Here are the tasks that didn't fit. Can you help me prioritize which of these to swap?"
    *   **The Benefit**: This avoids the trap of saying "No" while forcing your manager to see the trade-offs of your workload.

## Phase 3: Hack Back External Triggers
Eliminate the "pings, dings, and rings" that gain unauthorized access to your attention.

*   **Signal Your Status**: Use a "Concentration Crown" (a physical cue like a light or a sign on your monitor) to tell colleagues or family that you are indistractable.
*   **Clean Your Desktop**: Set "Do Not Disturb" on your computer from 12:00 AM to 11:59 PM. Manually allow only critical contacts.
*   **Group Notifications**: Disable all non-human notifications. If it's not a person needing an immediate answer, it shouldn't trigger a sound or vibration.

## Phase 4: Prevent Distraction with Pacts
Use "pre-commitments" as a final firewall. Only use these after mastering the first three phases.

*   **Effort Pacts**: Use tools to make distraction harder than focus.
    *   **Apps**: Use *Forest* (killing a virtual tree if you leave the app) or *Focusmate* (booking a live body-doubling session).
    *   **Hardware**: Use an outlet timer to automatically shut off your internet router at a set "bedtime" to prevent late-night scrolling.
*   **Price Pacts**: Attach a financial penalty to failure. For example, "If I don't write 500 words by 9:00 AM, I have to burn a $100 bill or give it to a political cause I hate."
*   **Identity Pacts**: Adopt the identity of being "Indistractable." Just as a vegetarian doesn't "choose" not to eat meat, an Indistractable person doesn't "choose" to ignore their phone at dinner—it is simply part of who they are.

## Examples

**Example 1: Deep Work on a Product Strategy**
*   **Context**: You have 2 hours to finish a roadmap but keep checking Slack.
*   **Application**:
    1.  **Internal**: You feel the "itch" of anxiety about the roadmap's difficulty. Set a 10-minute timer and "surf" the anxiety.
    2.  **Traction**: That 2-hour block was already on your calendar (Step 2).
    3.  **External**: Put on your "Concentration Crown" sign.
    4.  **Pact**: Open *Focusmate* to have a partner watch you work.
*   **Output**: 2 hours of focused output with zero Slack interruptions.

**Example 2: Managing Home/Work Boundaries**
*   **Context**: You find yourself checking work email during dinner with family.
*   **Application**:
    1.  **Identify Trigger**: You feel the "itch" of uncertainty about a project status.
    2.  **Identity Pact**: Tell yourself, "I am Indistractable and I value my family time."
    3.  **Effort Pact**: Leave the phone in a "charging station" in a different room during dinner hours.
*   **Output**: High-quality presence with family, reinforcing the Indistractable identity.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **To-Do List Dependency**: To-do lists allow for infinite tasks without time constraints. This leads to "Productive Procrastination" (doing easy tasks to avoid the hard, important ones). **Solution**: Use the calendar as the primary source of truth.
*   **Moralizing Distraction**: Thinking you are "lazy" or "addicted." **Solution**: Realize it is an emotional regulation issue. If you don't address the underlying boredom or stress, you will always find a way to get distracted.
*   **The "Not-Yet" Backfire**: Trying to use abstinence ("I will not check Twitter") instead of delay ("I will check it in 10 minutes"). Total abstinence often creates a "rebound effect" of intense craving.
