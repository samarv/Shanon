name: strategic-project-auditing
description: A framework for objectively evaluating whether your current project or reporting structure is the best use of company resources. Use it when you suspect your project has lost strategic priority, when you feel misaligned with executive leadership, or when the company enters a downturn and needs to move from local to global optimization.

# Strategic Project Auditing

Most product managers view their project's survival and their personal level in the org chart as proxies for success. This framework flips that perspective, prioritizing the business's "global maxima" over your "local maxima." By objectively auditing your project's value and your own reporting alignment, you increase your long-term value to the organization.

## The Business-First Mindset
Adopt a "nose for talent and strategy" by looking at the company as a whole. Ask: "If I were the CEO or a founder, how would I prioritize the current investments of this team?"

## Phase 1: The Project Viability Audit
Perform this audit quarterly or when company growth begins to slow.

1.  **Assess Relative Priority:** List the top 3 company-wide goals. Does your project directly move the needle on any of them?
2.  **Evaluate Resource Efficiency:** Determine if your engineering headcount (e.g., 50 engineers) would deliver a higher ROI if moved to a core product area.
3.  **Check for "Chewing Glass" Resilience:** Is the team’s struggle productive (building a new model) or just a loss of stamina? If the team has lost the "ungodly level of faith" required for 0-to-1 work, it may be time to wind down.
4.  **Draft a "Self-Kill" Proposal:** If the project is low priority, draft a plan to integrate its best features into the core product and reallocate the team. 
    *   *Note:* In healthy cultures, advocating for your project’s cancellation to help the broader business is rewarded with higher-leverage opportunities.

## Phase 2: The "Layering" Diagnostic
If you are struggling to communicate with your manager or find their strategic questions "from another planet," evaluate if you should be "layered" (managed by someone else).

1.  **Identify the Gap:** Are you struggling because of a lack of skill, or a lack of compatible strategic thinking with your current manager?
2.  **Find the Strategic Anchor:** Identify a leader in the org who deeply understands your area and has the bandwidth to mentor you.
3.  **The Ask:** Propose a reporting change to your current manager.
    *   *Language:* "I think I would do better work and the organization would be more productive if I reported to [Person X]. This allows us to divide and conquer [Area Y] more effectively."

## Phase 3: The Growth Paranoia Check
Growth masks problems. If your product is growing at triple digits, look for "hidden friction."

1.  **Identify Single-Channel Risks:** Are you "living and dying by the sword" of one channel (e.g., SEO)?
2.  **Audit the Core Loop:** Is the current growth "burning through demand"? Check if your supply/liquidity can actually handle the traffic you are getting.
3.  **Prepare for the "Smile Graph":** Plan the transition to a more sustainable model (e.g., moving from "request-to-book" to "instant book") before growth goes negative.

## Examples

**Example 1: The YouTube Pivot**
*   **Context:** Joined via acquisition; leading a team of 50 to rebuild a standalone product.
*   **Application:** Realized the project wasn't a top-three priority for YouTube. Recommended winding down the standalone project and folding features into the main site.
*   **Output:** The project was canceled, and the PM was promoted to lead the "Creator" focus area for all of YouTube.

**Example 2: The Strategic Layering**
*   **Context:** PM reporting directly to the CEO but struggling with the CEO's high-level strategic style.
*   **Application:** Identified a more tactical, supportive leader (e.g., a Head of Product/Viewer) who could provide better day-to-day guidance.
*   **Output:** PM asked to be layered. The new reporting structure provided the support needed to eventually grow into a CPO role.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Bystander Syndrome:** Assuming only the CEO or Head of Product should think about strategy. You must bring a strategy to the table that shows you understand the whole business, not just your silo.
*   **The Stamina Trap:** Sticking with a failing project long after the team has "run out of steam." Innovation requires ungodly faith; once that's gone, the project is dead even if it still has funding.
*   **Optimizing for Local Maxima:** Keeping a team of engineers on a "pet project" because it makes you feel important, even though the core business is starving for resources.
*   **Ignoring Bits vs. Atoms:** Underestimating the difficulty of changing a product that involves real-world behavior (like service marketplaces). These require a higher degree of resilience than pure digital products.
