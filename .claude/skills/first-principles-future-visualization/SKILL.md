description: A strategic framework for moving beyond incrementalism ("climbing hills") to discover bold product visions ("finding mountains"). Use this when defining 3-5 year roadmaps, pivoting a product, or when the team is stuck in local maxima.

This framework allows product leaders to bypass current technical constraints and "induced demand" by visualizing the world as it will inevitably exist based on fundamental physics and economics.

## The "Mountain Finding" Workflow

### 1. Defrag the Calendar
Deep strategic visualization cannot happen in 30-minute increments between OKR reviews.
- Carve out a minimum of 2-4 hours of uninterrupted "deep work" time.
- Physically remove yourself from the office or digital distractions.
- Engage in "low-input" activities (hiking, running, or a silent commute) to allow the brain to move into a contemplative state.

### 2. Identify First Principles
Strip the problem down to its core physics and economic realities. Question the "why" behind every current industry standard.
- **Example Question:** "Why do we need a 4,000-pound vehicle to move one 150-pound human three miles?"
- **Analysis:** Identify if the current solution is fundamentally inefficient. If the physics don't make sense, a massive opportunity for a "mountain" exists (e.g., micro-mobility, autonomous pods).

### 3. The 10-Year Visualization Exercise
Close your eyes and build a salient, bird’s-eye view of the future 10 years from now.
- **Ignore your company's role initially:** Visualize how the world moves and operates absent of your product.
- **Look for the "Given" trends:** Identify technologies that are inevitable (e.g., "Autonomy is a given," "Costs of sensors will trend to zero").
- **Predict second-order effects:** If X becomes cheap and autonomous, what happens to Y? (e.g., If cars are autonomous and cheap, do parking garages become parks? Does traffic increase due to "induced demand"?).

### 4. Apply the "Mountain" Lens
Once the future landscape is clear, determine your product’s relationship to it:
- **Tailwinds:** How can the product ride the inevitable trends?
- **Friction:** Where does the current product rub against the future reality?
- **Intervention:** What specific piece of this future can only your team manifest?

### 5. Transition to the Brain Trust
Move from solo visualization to co-creation to stress-test the vision.
- **The "Whiteboard Only" Rule:** Gather 5-8 key stakeholders (Eng, Design, Data) for a full day.
- **Laptops Down:** Focus entirely on the whiteboard.
- **"Yes, And" Culture:** Use the Pixar "Brain Trust" model—riff on ideas without judgment or attachment to being "right."

## Examples

**Example 1: The Future of Urban Mobility**
- **Context:** A PM at a ride-sharing company looking for the next 5-year arc.
- **First Principle:** Moving people in cities is currently high-mass and high-energy.
- **Visualization:** 10 years out, autonomy makes single-occupancy vehicles so cheap that streets are perpetually gridlocked (induced demand).
- **Strategy:** Shared rides (pooling) and multi-modality (bikes/scooters) are not just "options" but physical necessities for a functioning city.
- **Output:** Shift investment from "cheaper single rides" to "high-capacity autonomous pooling infrastructure."

**Example 2: Marketplace Logistics**
- **Context:** Transitioning from a simple single-product marketplace to a complex multi-modal one.
- **Visualization:** A world where supply is no longer just "independent contractors" but includes autonomous fleets, third-party taxi companies, and different vehicle form factors.
- **Strategy:** Build a "Logistics Brain" that is supply-agnostic and optimizes for the highest utilization across all possible modes.
- **Output:** A multi-year tech roadmap for a marketplace that prices and matches based on supply type and quality rather than just distance.

## Common Pitfalls

- **The "Theory Land" Trap:** Spending weeks on beautiful whiteboard diagrams and PhD-level algorithms without building a prototype. If engineers describe the vision as "boiling the ocean," you have tilted too far into vision and need to pivot to execution.
- **"Ready, Fire, Aim":** Running through walls without checking if it's the right wall. This happens when teams skip the "First Principles" step and simply execute faster on a flawed premise.
- **The Content Addiction:** Filling every gap in the day with podcasts or music. True strategy requires "mind like water"—emptying the mind of to-dos so that creative energy can birth new ideas.
- **Mistaking the Finger for the Moon:** Focusing on the "optics" (the deck, the OKR presentation) rather than the actual product outcome. The presentation is a means to an end; the "mountain" is the actual impact on the world.
