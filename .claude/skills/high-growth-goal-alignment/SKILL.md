# High-Growth Goal Alignment

In rapidly changing environments, goals are primarily a communication tool, not just a tracking mechanism. Their purpose is to ensure that when any employee shows up at their desk, they know exactly what the most important thing to work on is. This framework moves away from complex, multi-line OKR spreadsheets toward a lean system of constraints and clear ownership.

## The Six Rules of Goal Alignment

Follow these rules to ensure goals drive actual progress rather than just administrative overhead.

### 1. Limit to Three Top-Level Goals
No company or department needs more than three primary goals. If you can govern a business as complex as Facebook with three goals, you can govern yours.
*   **Example:** 1. Growth (MAU), 2. Engagement (Retention), 3. Revenue.
*   **Action:** Audit your current list. If it exceeds three, consolidate or demote items to "sub-metrics."

### 2. Designate a "Tie-Breaker" Goal
One goal must "win in a fight." When resources are tight or directions conflict, the team must know which metric takes precedence.
*   **Application:** If Growth and Engagement clash (e.g., adding low-quality users), specify which one the company values more in the current phase.

### 3. Use "Explain it to a Five-Year-Old" Language
An intern starting on Monday should understand the goals immediately. 
*   **Avoid:** Internal jargon, complex acronyms, or multi-variable formulas.
*   **Test:** Ask a non-technical team member to explain what the goal means. If they struggle, simplify the phrasing.

### 4. Ensure Strategy "Hurts"
Real strategy is about what you are *not* doing. If your goal-setting process isn't painful, you aren't prioritizing enough.
*   **Action:** Explicitly list "Non-Goals." These are projects or metrics that are intentionally being ignored or deprioritized to ensure the primary goals succeed.

### 5. Assign One Owner per Goal
Every number must have exactly one name next to it. 
*   **The Rule:** If two people own a goal, nobody owns it. 
*   **Constraint:** The owner should not be the CEO; it should be the person closest to the work whose "ass is on the line" for that specific outcome.

### 6. Build the Review Process
Goals are useless without a follow-up cadence. 
*   **Action:** Establish a weekly or bi-weekly "Goal Health" review. Focus on what was learned from trying to move the number, rather than just whether the number went up or down.

## Implementation Guide

### Snorkel Before You Scuba
Before blaming individual performance for missed targets, use the **Waterline Model** to check for structural failures:
1.  **Check Structure (Snorkel):** Are the goals clear? Are roles defined? Are expectations documented?
2.  **Check Dynamics:** How is the team making decisions? Is conflict being resolved?
3.  **Check Interpersonal (Scuba):** Are there specific relationship issues between individuals?
4.  **Check Intrapersonal:** Is there a specific issue with one person's mindset or skills?

Always address the "Snorkel" level (Structure) first. 80% of team problems are solved by clarifying the goals and roles.

## Examples

**Example 1: Balancing Quality and Scale**
*   **Context:** A social media startup is growing fast but seeing a dip in user quality.
*   **Input:** Current goals are "Signups" and "DAU."
*   **Application:** Apply Rule #2 (Tie-Breaker). The leadership declares: "Engagement wins in a fight."
*   **Output:** The marketing team stops running high-volume, low-intent ads that drive signups but 0% retention, focusing instead on high-retention channels.

**Example 2: Resolving "Too Many Priorities"**
*   **Context:** A product team has 12 OKRs and feels paralyzed.
*   **Input:** A 100-line spreadsheet of tasks.
*   **Application:** Apply Rule #1 and Rule #4. Cut the list to 3 goals. Create a "Non-Goal" list of the other 9 items.
*   **Output:** The team stops attending meetings for the 9 non-goals, freeing up 15 hours a week to focus on the top 3.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **The "Letter Bomb" Promise:** Promising stability, specific titles, or that you'll "never hire a boss over someone" to make them feel good today. These are out of your control and will explode in your face in a year.
*   **Panic Hiring:** Growing headcount by more than 100% in a year. This usually leads to "duplication of work" where two people are hired for the same role without realizing it. Aim for 50% growth for "happy" scaling.
*   **Protecting Low Performers:** Spending all your time on "struggling" employees. High-growth environments require you to invest your energy into your high performers to get a 10x return.
*   **Avoiding Escalation:** Thinking escalation is "tattling." Escalation is a tool to unblock two people with equal power who cannot agree. Go to the person with the "Tie-Breaker" context immediately.
