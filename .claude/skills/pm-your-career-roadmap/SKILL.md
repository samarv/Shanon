# PM Your Career

Many elite product managers are "terrible PMs" of their own careers. They apply rigor to their products—writing specs, setting metrics, and building roadmaps—but allow their professional lives to drift based on serendipity. This framework treats your career as a product that requires a formal specification, a portfolio strategy, and a marketing plan.

## The Career Spec Framework

Draft a "Career Spec" to move from accidental growth to intentional agency. Use the same components you would for a product launch.

### 1. Define the North Star (The 5-Year Vision)
Identify exactly where you want to be in five years. 
- **The Measuring Stick:** When an opportunity arises (a new role, a reorg, a project), ask: "Does this get me closer to or further from my 5-year destination?"
- **Working Backward:** If your goal is to be a Fortune 100 Board Member or a CEO, identify the "elementary school" and "middle school" steps required to get there today.

### 2. Set Career Metrics
Don't just track your title or salary. Define the "features" of your career you want to build:
- **Skill Acquisition:** What specific crafts am I mastering (e.g., zero-to-one building, late-stage scaling, board management)?
- **Impact:** What is the scale of the problem I am solving?
- **Learning vs. Impact:** Balance your roles. You have the most impact in jobs you already know, but you learn the most in "newbie" roles. Alternate between "Impact phases" (leveraging expertise) and "Learning phases" (taking roles you aren't yet qualified for).

### 3. Manage Your Career Portfolio
Treat your career as a portfolio of bets.
- **Core Product Roles:** Focus on 5–10% incremental growth of existing metrics. These build your "core craft" and provide stability/resume credibility.
- **Innovation Bets (Big Swings):** These are zero-to-one projects within a company. They have a 50% failure rate but provide "career stories" and step-function growth. 
- **Timing:** Early in your career, prioritize Core Product roles to learn the mechanics. Once established, take a "Big Swing" every 2–3 years.

## Product Marketing for Your Career

A product can be technically perfect, but it fails if no one knows it exists. As an introvert or a "processor," you must learn to market the "light," not just the "lightbulb."

- **Reframe Self-Promotion:** Stop viewing it as "bragging." View it as "educating your manager on the team's impact" or "ensuring the team gets necessary resources."
- **Write What You Repeat:** If you explain a concept or a lesson more than once, write it down as an internal post or doc. 
- **Force Accountability:** Create a "Contract" with your manager. Example: Commit to publishing one internal update or industry insight per month to build your "voice" as a leader.

## The 30/60/90 Day "Landing" Plan

When starting a new role (the "Launch Phase"), use this sequence to build trust:

1.  **Days 1-30 (Listen & Learn):** Conduct a listening tour. Ask: "What is one thing I can do to help you this week?" Summarize your findings in a "State of the Union" doc to prove you heard them.
2.  **Days 31-60 (Align):** Present a vision based on your listening tour. Get agreement on the specific problems that need solving.
3.  **Days 61-90 (Execute):** Focus on "Quick Wins"—small, tangible improvements that build reciprocal trust with engineering and design.

## Examples

**Example 1: Evaluating a Role Change**
- **Context:** A Senior PM is offered a move from a stable "Checkout" team to an unproven "AI Shopping Assistant" team.
- **Input:** 5-year goal is to be a CPO at a mid-stage startup.
- **Application:** The user reviews their "Career Spec." They already have "Core Mechanics" mastered from the Checkout team. The AI role is a "Big Swing."
- **Output:** They take the AI role because, even if the product fails, the "Learning Metric" (building zero-to-one) is more valuable for a future CPO role than another year of 2% conversion wins.

**Example 2: Managing Up as an Introvert**
- **Context:** A PM's work is high-quality, but they are overlooked in calibrations because they are "quiet."
- **Input:** Hard data on a 15% lift in user retention.
- **Application:** Instead of waiting for the performance review, the PM sends a monthly "Learning Summary" to their VP.
- **Output:** The VP now has a paper trail of the PM's expertise, and the PM feels comfortable because they are "sharing data," not "promoting themselves."

## Common Pitfalls
- **The "Drift" Trap:** Accepting a promotion or new job just because it was offered, without checking if it aligns with your 5-year "Measuring Stick."
- **Perfectionism:** Treating career setbacks as catastrophic. Resilience is a skill; look at feedback as a "gift" of data to iterate on your "Product."
- **Over-Scrutiny of Innovation:** If you are leading a new project, don't ask for too many resources too early. Limelight in a large company leads to high scrutiny and "pruning." Build "out of the limelight" until you have initial traction.
- **Neglecting the "Home Life" Yin-Yang:** Failing to realize that the most important career decision is your partner. Ensure your "Home Life" is in balance so it doesn't engulf your "Career Product."
