# Strategy-Led Planning Bypass

Traditional planning cycles of 4–6 weeks are often a ritual of "false precision" that result in plans that are abandoned by February. This framework uses a "Real Product Strategy" to compress planning into three days, focusing on high-leverage decisions rather than template-filling.

## The "Real Strategy" Requirements

Before entering the planning period, you must have a strategy that addresses these three components. If these are not defined, you are not planning; you are just filling out spreadsheets.

1.  **Customer Motivation:** A clear articulation of why the user will care, beyond just "market demand."
2.  **Differentiation:** How the product wins against competitors or the status quo.
3.  **Distribution:** The specific mechanism by which the product reaches the user (not just "launching it").

## The 3-Day Planning Workflow

Follow these steps to bypass the standard corporate cycle once your Real Strategy is set.

### Step 1: Resource Approximation (Day 1)
Avoid "8 vs 9 engineer" arguments. Allocate resources based on strategic buckets rather than individual task estimates.
- **Run the business:** Maintenance and table stakes.
- **Strategic bets:** Projects that align with your differentiation and distribution.
- **Exploration:** High-risk/high-reward experiments.

### Step 2: Pre-Alignment (Day 2)
Do not wait for the "Big Reveal" meeting with executives. 
- Meet with key stakeholders (Sales, Engineering, Design leaders) individually.
- Use your Real Strategy as the filter: "Does this project accelerate our differentiation?"
- Resolve conflicts at the peer level so the executive review is a formality.

### Step 3: Rapid Artifact Generation (Day 3)
- **Bend the rules on templates:** If a corporate template requires details that don't add value (e.g., granular dates for a project six months out), provide high-level milestones instead.
- **Create the "One-Pager":** Distill the 4-week planning output into a single page that connects the strategy to the 3-5 key initiatives for the period.

## The One-Way Door Decision Test

To keep your plan from bloating during the year, apply this test to every new feature request or "table stakes" escalation:

1.  **Identify the "Two-Way Door" Illusion:** Most features that seem reversible are actually one-way doors. Once a feature is launched, killing it creates customer pain, support debt, and marketing confusion.
2.  **The Pause Rule:** Before committing to a "quick" feature, pause for 2 minutes to 2 days. 
3.  **The QBR Projection:** Imagine you are in a Quarterly Business Review (QBR) three months from now. If the feature has low adoption, will you be forced to add "more bells and whistles" just to justify its existence? If the answer is yes, do not add it to the plan.

## Examples

**Example 1: Strategic Alignment**
- **Context:** A PM is pressured to add an "AI Chat" feature because competitors have one.
- **Input:** The current Real Strategy focuses on "speed of transaction" as the primary differentiator.
- **Application:** The PM evaluates the request. AI Chat might slow down the user. It doesn't fit the "differentiation" pillar of the strategy.
- **Output:** The PM rejects the feature during Day 2 (Pre-Alignment), citing the strategy, and avoids 4 weeks of debating the roadmap with Engineering.

**Example 2: Resource Allocation**
- **Context:** A leader is told to provide a seat-by-seat headcount plan for the next year.
- **Input:** A roadmap with 10 features.
- **Application:** Instead of estimating each feature, the leader buckets the team: "60% on the core platform (Strategy), 20% on experimental API tools, 20% on maintenance."
- **Output:** A 3-day approval on headcount because the focus is on the *ratio* of investment rather than the precision of the features.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Confusing Alliteration with Insight:** Avoid falling for catchy phrases (e.g., "Fail Fast," "Fast Follow") without questioning the underlying mechanics. Evaluate the idea, not the metaphor.
- **Authority Bias:** Just because a famous CEO uses a specific framework (like "Two-Way Doors") doesn't mean it applies to your specific scope. At a PM level, most "doors" are harder to walk back through than they appear.
- **Using Favorable Anecdotes to Mask Data:** When a feature in your plan is failing, avoid the temptation to share one "life-changing" customer quote to protect the plan. Be honest about lack of adoption to prevent "throwing good engineering after bad."
- **Adhering to Low-Value Rituals:** If your company's planning template doesn't help you make better decisions, fill it out with the minimum viable effort and spend your time on the Real Strategy instead.
