description: A framework to replace company-centric funnels with a journey mapped to customer value. Use this when trial-to-paid conversion is low, when product onboarding feels disjointed, or when marketing and product teams are misaligned on "who" the target user is.

# Customer-Led Growth Mapping

Customer-Led Growth (CLG) moves away from "pushing people through a funnel" and instead focuses on mapping the customer's journey based on the value they receive. By identifying your best customers and understanding their "Job to be Done," you can align your messaging and product experience to accelerate activation and retention.

## Step 1: Identify Your "Best" Customers
Do not analyze your entire user base. Filter for "Best" customers to find the signal in the noise.
*   **Success Metric:** They get a ton of value and pay for the product.
*   **Efficiency Metric:** They are low-maintenance (low support burden).
*   **Recency Metric:** They signed up within the last 3–6 months. This is critical because they still remember "life before the product" and the specific triggers that led them to sign up.

## Step 2: Uncover the Job to be Done (JTBD)
Conduct surveys or interviews with these "Best" customers to identify the pattern of their "Job." Use this template:
**"When I [Situation], help me [Motivation], so I can [Desired Outcome]."**

Ask these specific questions:
1.  What was going on in your life when you started looking for a solution? (The Trigger)
2.  What were you using before, and what sucked about it? (The Struggle)
3.  What was the moment you realized our product would actually work for you? (First Value)
4.  What can you do now that you couldn't do before? (Desired Outcome)

## Step 3: Map the Customer Milestones
Instead of Pirate Metrics (AARRR), map the journey into three phases with specific milestones.

### Phase 1: The Struggle (Pre-Acquisition)
*   **Problem Milestone:** The user is experiencing pain in the "old way."
*   **Interest Milestone:** The user starts seeking a solution and lands on your site.

### Phase 2: Evaluation (Activation)
*   **First Value:** The user experiences a "small win" (Product Activation).
*   **Value Realization:** The user achieves their primary goal for the first time.

### Phase 3: Growth (Retention)
*   **Ongoing Value:** The user builds a habit and uses the product at a regular frequency.
*   **Value Growth:** The user expands usage, upgrades, or refers others.

## Step 4: Define Milestone-Specific KPIs
Set one measurable metric for every stage to identify exactly where users "fall off the train."

| Milestone | KPI Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Problem** | New unique website visitors |
| **Interest** | Conversion rate on primary CTA (Start Trial/Demo) |
| **First Value** | Completed 1st search OR integrated 1st data source |
| **Value Realization** | Exported 1 report OR invited 2 team members |
| **Ongoing Value** | Logged in 3+ times per week for 4 consecutive weeks |
| **Value Growth** | Account expansion or seat upgrade |

## Step 5: Operationalize the "Voice of Customer"
Create a 5–7 page **Messaging Guide** based on your research.
*   **Functional Benefits:** The specific features used to get the job done.
*   **Emotional Benefits:** How the user feels after solving the problem (e.g., "looking like a pro to my boss").
*   **Application:** Use this language in your website headers, email onboarding sequences, and in-app checklists.

## Examples

**Example 1: SparkToro (Audience Research Tool)**
*   **Context:** High traffic and signups, but low free-to-paid conversion.
*   **Research Finding:** Best customers used the "Lists" and "Export" features to prove value to stakeholders.
*   **Application:** They front-loaded the "List" feature in onboarding and created a product checklist.
*   **Output:** Trial-to-paid conversion rate doubled within two months.

**Example 2: Social Media Management Tool**
*   **Context:** Generic messaging was attracting the wrong users.
*   **Research Finding:** Identified a specific JTBD around "novel opportunity identification" for agencies.
*   **Application:** Updated website messaging to speak to agency pain points and shortened the trial from 30 days to 7 days to increase urgency.
*   **Output:** Website conversion increased by 89% and trial-to-paid increased by 40% because more qualified users were entering the flow.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Ignoring the "Struggle" Phase:** Marketers often start at the "Interest" phase. If you don't understand the user's life *before* they found you, your messaging will be generic and won't resonate.
*   **Measuring "Dead" Metrics:** Tracking "Logins" instead of "Value Moments." A login is not value; creating a report or performing a search is value.
*   **Assuming the Founder is the Customer:** Founders often build for their own past problems, but the market and customer needs evolve. If it's been 12+ months since you talked to a new customer, your mental model is likely outdated.
*   **No "Win-Back" Logic:** 70% of people log in once and never return. Without measuring the "First Value" KPI, you won't know who to target with re-engagement emails to pull them back into the product.
