# The Three Bs of Behavioral Design

The Three Bs is a framework for moving beyond vague goals like "engagement" to drive specific, predictable user actions. It recognizes that humans are not rational; we are driven by emotion, present bias, and social norms. By diagnosing the psychological barriers at every step of a user journey, you can design interventions that align with how people actually make decisions.

## 1. Define the Behavior (The First B)
The most common mistake is picking an outcome (e.g., "increase retention") rather than a behavior. You must get "uncomfortably specific" about the action you want the user to take.

*   **Be Specific:** Instead of "log in," define exactly what happens after.
*   **The Peloton Rule:** A specific behavior looks like: "Within 7 days of starting the app, the user completes two 10-minute workouts with two different instructors."
*   **The Conflict Test:** If your team isn't arguing over the specificity of the behavior, it’s not specific enough.

## 2. Identify and Reduce Barriers (The Second B)
Identify every hurdle between the user and the target behavior.

### Logistical Barriers
Physical or technical friction in the flow (e.g., number of form fields, credit card entry, wait times).
*   **Action:** Map every single screenshot of the user journey. If it’s 50 steps, document all 50.

### Cognitive Barriers
Psychological hurdles that stop a user even if the path is logistically clear.
*   **Uncertainty Aversion:** If a user is unsure about a result, they will stall or look for other options (e.g., "Will this doctor be good?").
*   **Status Quo Bias:** People stick to what they did yesterday. You must increase motivation to break the cycle.
*   **Information Aversion:** Users may avoid taking an action if they are afraid of the information they might receive (e.g., health test results).

## 3. Amplify Benefits (The Third B)
Humans suffer from **Present Bias**: we prioritize our current self over our future self. You must provide a reason to act *today*, not a reason that pays off in six months.

*   **Immediate Rewards:** Use "Right for Wrong"—helping people do the right thing for a "wrong" (immediate/tangential) reason.
    *   *Example:* A user works out (the right thing) because they want to see the "unicorn confetti" or keep a "streak" alive (the immediate reward), rather than for long-term heart health.
*   **Social Norms:** Highlight that "everyone else is doing it" to decrease the cognitive load of decision-making.
*   **Completion Bias:** Use progress bars or checkboxes to trigger the human desire to finish a started task.

## The Behavioral Diagnosis Process
To apply the Three Bs, perform a "Behavioral Diagnosis" on your product:
1.  **Map the Journey:** Create a deck with 100+ screenshots of the exact flow.
2.  **Layer Psychology:** At every step, label the specific psychology at play (e.g., "Here, the user faces Choice Overload").
3.  **Identify the "Hot State":** Determine where the user is most motivated and where they are "cold" or annoyed.
4.  **Insert Strategic Friction (Counter-intuitive):** If you want someone to do *less* of something (like sharing misinformation), add barriers. If you want them to do *more*, add "motivational friction" (e.g., a quiz that highlights the benefit of the product).

## Examples

**Example 1: Reducing Misinformation (TikTok)**
*   **Context:** Users were sharing unverified information too quickly.
*   **Behavior:** Decrease the "Share" action on unverified videos.
*   **Application:** Added a "Are you sure?" popup after the share button was clicked.
*   **Result:** This "logistical friction" forced a "cold state" reconsideration, reducing shares by 24%.

**Example 2: Improving Onboarding (One Medical)**
*   **Context:** Users signed up but didn't book appointments until they were sick months later, often forgetting the app.
*   **Behavior:** Book an appointment during the initial onboarding.
*   **Application:** 
    *   Reduced **Choice Overload** by recommending one specific doctor instead of a list.
    *   Reduced **Logistical Friction** by suggesting virtual appointments for the very next day.
*   **Result:** Bookings increased by 20%.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Measuring Outcomes, Not Actions:** Don't set KPIs for "Active Users." Set KPIs for the specific behavior (e.g., "Set up a recurring deposit").
*   **Underestimating Cognitive Load:** Just because a button is big doesn't mean the user knows *why* they should click it. Address the "Uncertainty Aversion."
*   **Relying on Future Benefits:** Don't tell a user they will "save for retirement." Tell them they will "complete their profile today" or "get a $10 bonus now."
*   **Asking Open-Ended Questions:** In sign-up flows, open text fields are massive cognitive barriers. Use multiple-choice or dropdowns to keep the user in a "flow state."
