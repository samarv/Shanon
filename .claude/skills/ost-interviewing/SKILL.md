# OST Interviewing

Master the art of story-based customer interviews that reveal unmet needs, pain points, and desires.

## Core Principle

**Opportunities emerge from stories, not from direct questions.**

Ask customers to tell stories about their experiences. The gold is in the narrative details, not the opinions.

## The Wrong Way to Interview

### Don't Ask Direct Questions
- "What do you like to watch on Netflix?"
- "What features do you want?"
- "How would you improve this product?"
- "What's your biggest pain point?"

**Why this fails**:
- Leads to unreliable, surface-level answers
- Misses actual behavior and context
- Gets opinions instead of needs
- Customers suggest solutions, not problems

## The Right Way to Interview

### Ask for Stories
- "Tell me about the last time you watched something on a streaming service."
- "Walk me through what happened when you tried to [do task X]."
- "Can you describe a recent time when you struggled with [context]?"

### Follow Up Relentlessly
- "What happened next?"
- "Tell me more about that."
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What did you do then?"
- "Why do you think that happened?"

## Interview Structure

### Opening (5 minutes)
1. **Set context**: Explain you're learning about their experience, not selling
2. **Make it conversational**: "This is just a conversation, not a formal interview"
3. **Ask permission**: "Is it OK if I take notes?"

### Story Collection (40-50 minutes)
4. **Start with recent behavior**: "Tell me about the last time you..."
5. **Let them talk**: Don't interrupt the narrative flow
6. **Follow the thread**: Ask "What happened next?" to keep the story going
7. **Dig deeper on struggles**: When they mention difficulty, explore it
8. **Get specifics**: Ask for actual screen names, button labels, exact steps

### Closing (5 minutes)
9. **Thank them**: Acknowledge their time and insights
10. **Ask for permission**: "Can I follow up if I have more questions?"

## Question Patterns

### Pattern 1: Recent Behavior
"Tell me about the last time you [did relevant task]."

**Why it works**: Recent memories are more accurate, less filtered by opinion

**Example**:
- "Tell me about the last time you tried to book a meeting room"
- "Walk me through the last time you filed an expense report"
- "Describe what happened the last time you onboarded a new team member"

### Pattern 2: Narrative Continuation
"What happened next?"

**Why it works**: Keeps the story flowing, reveals the full sequence

**Example conversation**:
- User: "I opened the app to find a restaurant"
- You: "What happened next?"
- User: "The search bar wasn't where I expected it"
- You: "Tell me more about that"
- User: "I kept looking at the top of the screen but it was hidden in a menu"

### Pattern 3: Specific Instance
"Can you walk me through exactly what you did?"

**Why it works**: Gets concrete details instead of generalizations

**Example**:
- "Which button did you click?"
- "What was the exact error message?"
- "Where on the screen were you looking?"
- "How long did you wait?"

### Pattern 4: Emotional Response
"How did that make you feel?"

**Why it works**: Reveals intensity of the pain point

**Example**:
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What went through your mind at that moment?"
- "What did you think when that happened?"

### Pattern 5: Context Expansion
"Tell me more about [specific detail they mentioned]."

**Why it works**: Extracts opportunities from throwaway comments

**Example**:
- User: "I had to check three different places"
- You: "Tell me more about those three places"
- [Opportunity discovered: "I can't see all my information in one view"]

## Listening for Opportunities

### What to Listen For

**Pain points** (Struggles, friction, frustration):
- "It was hard to..."
- "I couldn't figure out..."
- "I got stuck when..."
- "I had to do X multiple times..."

**Workarounds** (Indicates unmet need):
- "So I just..."
- "My hack is to..."
- "I use [other tool] to..."
- "I have to remember to..."

**Time sinks** (Inefficiency):
- "That took forever"
- "I waste so much time on..."
- "I have to wait for..."

**Confusion** (Lack of clarity):
- "I didn't know..."
- "I couldn't tell..."
- "I wasn't sure if..."

**Gaps** (Missing capability):
- "I wish I could see..."
- "There's no way to..."
- "I can't find..."

### Extract the Opportunity

**Story**: "Last week I was trying to book a conference room for a client meeting. I checked our room booking system and found a room available at 2pm. But when I got there with the client, someone else was in the room. Turns out they had booked it through a different system. I had to scramble to find another space while my client waited in the hallway. It was embarrassing."

**Opportunities identified**:
1. "I can't tell if a room is actually available across all booking systems"
2. "I risk embarrassing moments when room bookings conflict"
3. "I can't quickly find alternative space when my booking falls through"

## Interview Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Leading Questions
- Bad: "Would you like a dark mode?"
- Good: "Tell me about a time when you used the app in different lighting conditions"

### Anti-Pattern 2: Hypotheticals
- Bad: "If we built feature X, would you use it?"
- Good: "Tell me about the last time you tried to accomplish [what feature X would enable]"

### Anti-Pattern 3: Asking for Solutions
- Bad: "What features should we build?"
- Good: "What's been difficult about using the product lately?"

### Anti-Pattern 4: Stopping at Surface Level
- Bad: [Customer mentions issue] → Move to next question
- Good: [Customer mentions issue] → "Tell me more about that" → "What happened next?" → "How did you handle it?"

### Anti-Pattern 5: Batch Questions
- Bad: "Can you tell me about X and Y and how they relate to Z?"
- Good: "Can you tell me about X?" → [They answer] → "What about Y?" → [They answer] → "How does that relate to Z?"

## Note-Taking Strategy

### During the Interview
- Focus on listening, not writing
- Jot brief phrases, not full sentences
- Mark moments to return to with asterisks (*)
- Note exact quotes that stand out

### Immediately After
- Expand notes while memory is fresh
- Write out full stories
- Identify opportunities
- Tag by experience map phase

### Example Note Format
```
Interview: Sarah M., Product Manager, 3 years experience
Date: 2024-01-15
Context: Weekly planning workflow

Story 1: Sprint planning chaos
"Last Monday we had sprint planning. I had tasks in Jira, designs in Figma, and specs in Notion. I spent 20 minutes just gathering everything to share my screen. The engineers were waiting. One of them said 'this happens every time.'"

Opportunities:
- "I can't gather my work artifacts quickly for meetings"
- "My team waits on me to find and share context"
- "I feel disorganized when my work is scattered across tools"

Phase: Planning / Preparation
```

## Interview Frequency

Teresa Torres recommends **weekly interviews** for continuous discovery.

### Why Weekly?
- Keeps you connected to customer reality
- Builds pattern recognition skill
- Creates steady flow of fresh opportunities
- Prevents "big batch" research bias

### Who to Interview?
- Current customers (various segments)
- Recent churned customers
- Near-miss prospects (almost bought)
- Power users
- Struggling users

## Sample Interview Guide

### For [Product Category]: Task Management

**Opening**: "Thanks for taking time to chat. I'm learning about how people manage their work, and I'd love to hear about your experience. This is just a conversation - there are no wrong answers. Is it OK if I take notes?"

**Story prompts**:
1. "Tell me about the last time you planned your week"
   - What happened next?
   - How did you decide what to work on?
   - Where did you capture that information?

2. "Walk me through a recent time when your plan fell apart"
   - What happened?
   - How did you adapt?
   - What made that difficult?

3. "Describe the last time you needed to share your progress with someone"
   - What did you share?
   - How did you pull that information together?
   - How long did that take?

**Closing**: "This has been really helpful, thank you. Can I follow up if I have more questions?"

## Skill Development

Interview skill compounds with practice:

**Interview 1-10**: You'll miss most opportunities, struggle with follow-ups, ask leading questions

**Interview 11-30**: You start recognizing patterns, get better at follow-ups, notice when customers offer solutions

**Interview 31-50**: Opportunities jump out at you, follow-ups feel natural, you can interview anyone about anything

**Interview 51+**: You hear opportunities in everyday conversations, conduct interviews without a guide, extract gold reliably

## Common Struggles

### "They're giving me solutions, not problems"
**Fix**: When they suggest a feature, ask "What problem would that solve for you?" Then: "Tell me about the last time you experienced that problem."

### "They're being too general"
**Fix**: Ask for a specific recent instance. "Can you walk me through the last time that happened?"

### "The conversation feels stilted"
**Fix**: You're probably asking too many questions too fast. After they answer, wait 2-3 seconds in silence. They'll often fill the gap with the good stuff.

### "I'm not hearing any opportunities"
**Fix**: You're probably not asking enough follow-ups. Every time they mention a struggle, dig deeper: "Tell me more about that" → "What happened next?" → "How did that make you feel?"

### "They keep saying everything is fine"
**Fix**: Ask about the last time they tried to do something, even if it worked. The story will reveal friction: "Walk me through the last time you [did task], step by step."

## Red Flags in Your Own Interview

Signs you're not doing it right:

- Interview is shorter than 30 minutes (not enough depth)
- You asked more than 10 distinct questions (not enough follow-ups)
- You don't have direct quotes in your notes (not capturing stories)
- You can't identify 3+ opportunities from the interview (stayed too surface-level)
- The customer talked less than 80% of the time (you talked too much)
- You left without understanding their specific workflow (too abstract)

## Making It Conversational

### Techniques

**Reflect back**: "So it sounds like you had to check three different places, is that right?"

**Express curiosity**: "That's interesting - I want to understand that better. Walk me through exactly what you did."

**Acknowledge emotion**: "That sounds frustrating. What did you do next?"

**Build on their words**: Use their terminology, not yours. If they say "dashboard," say "dashboard," not "home screen."

## Output Artifacts

After each interview, produce:

1. **Full interview notes** with stories and direct quotes
2. **Opportunity list** extracted from the interview
3. **Experience map tagging** showing which journey phases were covered
4. **Patterns** noted if this connects to other interviews
5. **Follow-up questions** for future interviews

## Integration with Opportunity Solution Tree

Interview insights feed directly into the OST:

1. **Stories** → Evidence for opportunities
2. **Customer quotes** → Validation of opportunity specificity
3. **Journey phases** → Experience map structure
4. **Patterns across interviews** → Confidence level in opportunities

Each interview should add branches to your tree or increase confidence in existing branches.
