# Winning Tactic to Strategy

This framework, used by Marc Benioff to launch Salesforce and its recent pivot to Agentforce, rejects the idea of a fixed, pre-planned strategy. Instead, it treats the market as a testing ground where you "throw everything against the wall" to identify which specific tactic generates the most energy, then scale that tactic into your primary strategy.

## The Process

### 1. Define the "One Big Thing"
Before experimenting, align the entire organization on a single focal point. You cannot test tactics across multiple unrelated goals.
*   **Example:** For Salesforce in 2024, the "One Big Thing" is Agentforce (Digital Labor).
*   **Example:** In 2000, it was "The End of Software."

### 2. Deploy High-Variance Tactics
Launch 5–6 diverse, "remarkable" tactics simultaneously. These should be designed to provoke a reaction or "break through the noise."
*   **Competitive Positioning:** Aggressively market against a competitor's specific weakness (e.g., Salesforce positioning against Microsoft Copilot).
*   **Staged Reality:** Create "remarkable" moments that people must remark upon (e.g., hiring fake protesters and a fake news crew for a competitor’s conference).
*   **Celebrity/Cultural Integration:** Use "generous" relationships to create unexpected content (e.g., Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson ads).
*   **Customer Zero:** Use your own product internally to generate proof points (e.g., Salesforce resolving 83% of inquiries via Agentforce before selling it).

### 3. Monitor "Energy" and Traction
Act like a comedian testing jokes in a small club before a Netflix special. Watch for:
*   Viral pickup on social media or press.
*   Direct customer feedback and "Aha!" moments during sales calls.
*   Internal adoption speed and employee excitement.

### 4. Pivot Tactic to Strategy
Once a specific tactic shows clear resonance, move from "experimentation" to "orchestration."
*   **Fuel the Fire:** Reallocate resources from failing tactics to the winner.
*   **Scale Distribution:** Hire specialized roles (e.g., 1,000–2,000 new AEs) specifically to sell the proven angle.
*   **Hardwire the Message:** Update the product roadmap and customer stories to center on the winning tactic.

## Cultivating the "Beginner’s Mind" (Shoshin)
To execute this effectively, you must avoid the "Expert's Mind," which assumes it already knows what the market wants.
*   **Clear the Slate:** Use mindfulness or physical relocation (going to a different environment) to detach from past successes.
*   **Invite Possibility:** In the beginner’s mind, there are many possibilities; in the expert’s mind, there are few. 
*   **Question Linear Success:** Accept that there is no "up-and-to-the-right" line without periods of "dumpster fires" or failures.

## Examples

**Example 1: The Salesforce Launch (2000)**
*   **Context:** Launching a CRM when Siebel Systems dominated.
*   **Tactics:** Hired actors to protest "software" outside Siebel’s conference; created a fake news crew (K-N-M-S: "No More Software") to interview them.
*   **Result:** The "End of Software" became a viral movement, turning a guerrilla marketing tactic into a 20-year company strategy.

**Example 2: The Agentforce Pivot (2024)**
*   **Context:** Shifting from "Data Cloud" to "AI Agents" mid-fiscal year.
*   **Tactics:** Accelerated code delivery via acquisition (Airkit/Airforce); ran ads with McConaughey/Harrelson; flipped the entire Dreamforce conference to a single-topic event.
*   **Result:** Rapidly shifted market perception from "Salesforce is late to AI" to "Salesforce is the leader in agentic workflows."

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Playing the Clarinet, Not the Orchestra:** Only focusing on one function (e.g., only product or only sales). You must lead the "symphony" of marketing, sales, product, and stakeholders simultaneously.
*   **Fear of "Frivolous" Ideas:** Dismissing high-variance tactics (like protesters or celebrity ads) because they don't feel "enterprise-grade." If it's not remarkable, it won't break through the noise.
*   **Over-Hiring During Peaks:** Hiring based on temporary "robustness" (like during a pandemic) rather than sustainable cycles.
*   **Narrowcasting:** Focusing on only one stakeholder (like investors) while ignoring customer stories or employee energy.
