# Candidate-Market Fit Assessment

Candidate-Market Fit (CMF) is the process of treating yourself as the product and the hiring market as the customer. Instead of "spraying and praying" with generic applications, you develop a narrow, high-conviction "spear" (a focused target) rather than a "net" (a broad, vague search).

## The Mnookin Two-Pager Template

Before talking to the market, define your internal boundaries. Create a two-page document with the following sections:

1.  **What I Want:** List the roles, cultures, and types of problems that energize you.
2.  **What I Don’t Want:** List specific industries, management styles, or company sizes you refuse to work in (e.g., "no heavy bureaucracy," "no early-stage hardware").
3.  **Core Assets:** Your 3–5 most marketable skills and the "receipts" (metrics) to prove them.

## The Listening Tour

Validate your CMF by gathering market data from 10–15 trusted contacts (former colleagues, peers, or recruiters).

### 1. Conduct Reverse Exit Interviews
Ask former colleagues: "When we worked together, what did I do exceptionally well, and what were the areas where I struggled? Based on that, what kind of environment do you think I would thrive in now?"

### 2. Ask the "Golden Question"
In every networking call, share your Mnookin Two-Pager and ask: **"If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this search?"**

### 3. Seek Recruiter Feedback
Ask recruiters: "Given the current market, what level of role do you see people with my background actually getting hired for? Is my 'want' list realistic for the current tech climate?"

## Define Your CMF Statement

Distill your research into a single-sentence "spear." A successful CMF statement typically includes: **Role Level + Company Stage + Industry + Specific Problem Set.**

*   **Weak (The Net):** "I'm looking for a Director of Product role at a growth-stage startup."
*   **Strong (The Spear):** "I'm looking for a Director of Product role at a Series B healthcare startup in San Francisco where I can lead the transition from a founder-led product to a professionalized product organization."

## Examples

**Example 1: The Tactical Pivot**
*   **Context:** A VP of Product from a traditional media company wants to move into high-growth streaming.
*   **Input:** Initial search for VP roles failed because streaming leaders didn't value "old media" management experience.
*   **Application:** During the Listening Tour, the candidate realized the market only valued their domain expertise, not their title.
*   **Output:** New CMF Statement: "Individual Contributor (IC) Product role at a Tier-1 streaming service (Netflix/Apple TV) to help bridge the gap between content licensing and product features."

**Example 2: The Niche Recovery**
*   **Context:** A Chief Data Officer has been searching for a year for a CTO role with no offers.
*   **Input:** Realized they were competing against career CTOs at tech giants.
*   **Application:** Narrowed focus to industries that were "lagging" in data sophistication but had high capital.
*   **Output:** New CMF Statement: "CTO for a mid-size regional bank looking to modernize their data infrastructure for SOC 2 compliance." (Resulted in 3 offers in 3 weeks).

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Using a "Net" instead of a "Spear":** Fearing that being specific will limit opportunities. In reality, people cannot help you if your request is too broad; they can only "expand" on a narrow request (e.g., "I know you're looking for Healthcare, but I have a Fintech role that fits your specific skills").
*   **Ignoring the "Technology Frontier":** Failing to realize that the market has moved. If you are not close to the current frontier (e.g., AI, specific modern stacks), you may need to take a title "step down" to move "closer" to the innovation.
*   **Failing to Iterate:** Treating your CMF as a static document. If you aren't getting interviews after 10–15 Listening Tour calls, your CMF is likely a "miss" and needs to be narrowed or adjusted for current supply and demand.
*   **Searching Alone:** Doing this process without a "Job Search Council" (a group of 6–8 peers). Without external feedback, your "inner critic" or ego will prevent you from seeing your actual market value.
