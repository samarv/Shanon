# Career Progress Framework (Job Moves)

Value Proposition: Stop choosing jobs based on features (salary/title) and start "hiring" roles that provide the specific experiences and progress you need. By identifying your current "Quest" and analyzing your energy drivers, you can find a role that reduces stress and increases productivity.

## 1. Diagnose Your Career Quest
Identify which of the four primary "quests" is driving your desire to change. Each quest requires a different strategy for your next move.

*   **Get Out:** You are in a toxic or exhausting environment. Your priority is to stop the bleeding. Look for a **"Jobcation"**—a role you can do with "one hand tied behind your back" to rest and recover.
*   **Take the Next Step:** You have mastered your current role but the path upward is blocked. Optimize for skill acquisition and "half-steps" that lead to your ultimate long-term goal.
*   **Regain Control:** Your work is bleeding into your personal life. Optimize for time management, boundaries, and autonomy over your schedule.
*   **Realignment:** You were promoted or shifted into work you dislike (e.g., a maker moved into management). Optimize for getting back to the core tasks you actually enjoy and excel at.

## 2. Conduct an Energy Audit
Analyze the specific contexts that give you energy versus those that drain it.

1.  **Review the last 12 months:** List 3–5 moments where you felt a "2X or 3X" surge in energy. Identify the context: Who were you with? What was the specific problem? What was the pace?
2.  **Identify Drains:** List moments that left you depleted. Use the "Bottom 5" of a strengths assessment (like StrengthsFinder) to identify tasks that inherently drain you because they are outside your natural wiring.
3.  **Define Requirements:** Convert these into design requirements. 
    *   *Bad:* "I want to learn."
    *   *Good:* "I need a role where I am solving a new problem every week because I get bored once I master a process."

## 3. Prototype Your Next Job
Before applying, test your assumptions about a role through informational interviews.

1.  **Go Wide:** Identify 3–5 different industries or roles where your energy drivers might fit (e.g., a neuroscientist looking at NatGeo coordinating).
2.  **The "Undercover" Interview:** Find people currently in those roles on LinkedIn. Ask: "What is a typical Tuesday like?" "When do you feel most stressed?" "What does progress look like in this seat?"
3.  **Check the Reality:** Compare their answers to your energy drivers. If a "travel" job is actually 90% logistics and 10% travel, and you hate logistics, discard it.

## 4. Craft Your Career Story
Use the "Pixar Template" to explain your move to hiring managers. This makes the abstract "why" of your career concrete.

*   **Once upon a time...** [Your background/early career]
*   **Every day...** [How you used your core skills]
*   **Until one day...** [The moment you realized you needed a change]
*   **Because of that...** [The steps you took to learn/shift]
*   **Because of that...** [The results of those steps]
*   **Until finally...** [Why you are applying for *this* specific role now]

## Examples

**Example 1: The Startup Burnout (Get Out Quest)**
*   **Context:** A PM at a high-growth startup has been working 80-hour weeks for three years and feels "hollowed out."
*   **Input:** High energy for problem-solving; extreme drain from "people issues" and lack of sleep.
*   **Application:** The PM identifies a "Jobcation" at a stable, mid-sized company. They intentionally take a Senior PM role instead of a Director role.
*   **Output:** They trade a higher title for a 40-hour work week, using the extra energy to go to the gym and reconnect with family, with a plan to "re-enter" high growth in 18 months.

**Example 2: The Blocked Leader (Next Step Quest)**
*   **Context:** A Director of Engineering wants to be a CTO but the current CTO is a co-founder and isn't leaving.
*   **Input:** Energy comes from "making the abstract concrete" and strategy; drain comes from routine maintenance.
*   **Application:** Instead of applying for other Director roles, they prototype a "Chief of Staff" role for a serial entrepreneur. 
*   **Output:** They take a lateral salary move but gain the "experience" of seeing how a CEO operates, preparing them for a CTO/Founder role as their "skip-job."

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Hiring for Features:** Choosing a job based on the salary or "VP" title when the day-to-day "experience" (the meetings, the pace, the culture) is a known energy drain.
*   **The "Same Job, Different Office" Trap:** Leaving a job because of a "Get Out" push but taking the exact same role at a competitor. You will likely feel the same "push" within 6 months.
*   **Faking the Interview:** Trying to convince a manager you are good at everything. Instead, be honest: "I am a 10/10 at innovation and a 3/10 at harmony; I need a partner who can manage the team's interpersonal dynamics so I can focus on the product."
*   **Ignoring the Pushes:** Thinking you can "power through" a role when you have 4+ "pushes" (disrespect, lack of learning, no control). Without addresssing the pushes, you will never feel settled.
