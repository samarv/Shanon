name: saying-the-unsayable
description: A communication framework for surfacing hidden tensions, delivering difficult feedback, and naming "elephants in the room" without triggering defensiveness. Use this during high-stakes meetings where teams are in unacknowledged conflict, when giving "brutal" but constructive performance feedback, or when you notice a disconnect between what is being said and what is actually happening.

# Saying the Unsayable

This framework, developed by Claire Hughes Johnson, allows you to "say the thing you think you cannot say" to maintain momentum and clarity. By moving from a "Lecturer" to an "Explorer" mindset, you can surface brutal truths while leaving the recipient feeling optimistic and empowered.

## The "Left-Hand Column" Method
Every conversation has a "Left-Hand Column"—the running commentary in your head that is often harsh, judgmental, or cynical. To communicate effectively, you must "detoxify" this column before speaking.

1.  **Identify the internal thought:** Acknowledge the blunt thought (e.g., "This project is a disaster because the PM is lazy").
2.  **Strip the judgment:** Remove the "blame" and find the objective observation (e.g., "The project is behind schedule").
3.  **Identify the shared goal:** Remember that you both want progress, impact, and momentum.
4.  **Reframe as an inquiry:** Turn the observation into a collaborative question.

## Step-by-Step Application

### 1. Be an Explorer, Not a Lecturer
Do not approach the conversation as an expert delivering a verdict. Instead, act as a partner in discovery.
*   **Lecturer approach:** "You botched that presentation because you were unprepared."
*   **Explorer approach:** "I have a hypothesis I want to test with you. My experience of the meeting was that the energy shifted when we hit slide four. How did you feel that section went?"

### 2. Make the Implicit Explicit
Conflict often stems from things that are "felt" but not "named."
*   **Name the tension:** "I feel like there is something we aren't talking about in this room."
*   **Own the observation:** Use "I" statements to describe your perception rather than stating facts about the other person.
*   **Invite correction:** End with "Am I seeing that correctly?" or "Is that your experience as well?"

### 3. Use Hypothesis-Based Coaching
Don't wait for "perfect" data to provide feedback. Use "well-informed intuition" to start the conversation early.
*   **State the pattern:** "I've noticed a pattern where you back your chair away from the table during roadmap discussions."
*   **Offer the hypothesis:** "It makes me wonder if you disagree with the direction but don't feel comfortable vocalizing it."
*   **Ask for the truth:** "What is actually going on for you in those moments?"

## Examples

### Example 1: Surfacing Team Conflict
*   **Context:** Two teams (Product and Engineering) are in a meeting. They are talking in circles about a delay, but it’s clear they are actually fighting over who owns the final decision.
*   **The Unsayable:** "You guys are both being territorial and it's annoying."
*   **Application:** "I’m going to make the implicit explicit. It feels like we have two teams that both believe they own the final sign-off on this feature. If we don't know who the decision-maker is, we're going to slow the company down. Can we pause to clarify who the 'D' is here?"
*   **Output:** The teams stop the circular technical argument and align on a decision-making framework (like a RACI or SPADE).

### Example 2: Giving Critical Performance Feedback
*   **Context:** A high-performing lead is becoming increasingly defensive in group settings, which is starting to demotivate the junior staff.
*   **The Unsayable:** "You're acting like a jerk in meetings and it's making people quit."
*   **Application:** "I have a hypothesis I'd like to explore. I've observed that when someone asks a clarifying question, your tone becomes very short. My experience of that is that it shuts down the dialogue. Is that your intention, or are you feeling a pressure I don't see?"
*   **Output:** The lead recognizes the impact of their "default" behavior and discusses the underlying stressor (e.g., unrealistic deadlines).

## Common Pitfalls

*   **Waiting for Perfect Data:** Do not wait for a "mountain of evidence" before speaking up. This leads to resentment. Use a "hypothesis" to bring up observations early.
*   **Using "You" Judgments:** Saying "You are defensive" triggers the amygdala. Saying "I noticed you crossed your arms and stopped speaking" describes a physical fact that can be discussed objectively.
*   **Filtering Yourself Out:** Many leaders stay silent to be "nice," but this is actually "unkind" because it allows the person to fail. Real kindness is surfacing the truth so the person can improve.
*   **Forgetting the "Optimism" Coda:** After delivering a hard truth, always pivot back to the shared goal. "I'm telling you this because I know how much impact you can have, and I want to remove the friction that's standing in your way."
