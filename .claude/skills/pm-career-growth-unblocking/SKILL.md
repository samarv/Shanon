## Overview
Success in a product management career requires shifting from a short-term focus (the next promotion) to a long-term "Skip" strategy (the job *after* the next one). This skill helps you diagnose why you are stalled and how to build a "career story" that makes you world-class in a specific lane of product leadership.

## The Promotion Diagnosis Framework
If you are not getting promoted, you must identify which of these four roadblocks is the primary cause. Do not ask your manager "What do I do to get promoted?" Instead, use this checklist to find the ground truth.

### 1. The Advocacy Gap
You may have the "magic," but the people in the room (your manager or the promotion committee) don't see it or aren't championing it.
- **Action:** Get "ground truth" feedback by triangulating from peers and cross-functional partners. Ask: "What is the one thing holding me back from being seen as a leader in this room?"

### 2. The Role Gap
You are qualified, but the organizational structure has no opening at the next level. This is common in "ex-growth" companies or during "layers-to-ICs" restructures.
- **Action:** Evaluate if your current environment allows for growth. If the next role doesn't exist, you are in a "lateral" trap.

### 3. The Impatience Gap
High performers often expect annual promotions. Leadership skills (soft skills, influence, strategy) take longer to absorb and have lagging impact.
- **Action:** Compare your tenure to the company's average for that level. If you are trying to turn a 2-year cycle into 18 months, recognize the system is working as intended.

### 4. The Development Gap
There is a substantive weakness you are either unaware of or refusing to hear.
- **Action:** Look for "shadows of superpowers." If you are a "great collaborator," the shadow might be that you are "indecisive" or "lack an opinion." 

## The "Skip" Career Strategy
Stop looking at your boss’s job; look at your boss’s boss’s job (The Skip). 

1. **Identify your Mastery Lane:** Pick one of the five product ambiguities to become world-class in:
    - **Craft:** Excellence in the "how" of building.
    - **Market Ambiguity:** Navigating zero-to-one and product-market fit.
    - **Organizational Ambiguity:** Solving "inside the building" problems for complex teams.
    - **Domain Expertise:** Deep technical or industry knowledge (e.g., ML, Fintech).
    - **Growth:** Mastering the mechanics of scaling and distribution.
2. **Write Your Future Paragraph:** Write the paragraph you want to tell a recruiter in two years. 
    - Use "I," not "we." 
    - **Template:** "I was faced with [Specific Headwind]. I used [Specific Skill/Lane] to solve [Problem], which resulted in [Metric/Impact]."
3. **Audit Your Current Work:** If the work you are doing today doesn't let you write that paragraph, you are in a "short-term" trap.

## Evaluating "Ex-Growth" Companies
Avoid joining or staying at companies that have raised significant capital but lack a "sucking sound" of customer demand.

- **The Test:** Ask, "Are we scaling a product that customers are pulling out of our hands, or are we trying to find that pulling sensation with 300+ people?"
- **The Warning:** If the company is worth hundreds of millions but is still "searching for fit," your equity is likely underwater. The opportunity cost of staying is too high.

## Examples

**Example 1: The Stalled Senior PM**
- **Context:** A Senior PM at a large tech company has been at the same level for three years and is frustrated.
- **Diagnosis:** They are a "Great Communicator" (Superpower), but feedback says they "struggle with technical strategy."
- **Application:** They realize their communication superpower has become a shadow—they spend so much time "aligning" that they never form a hard technical opinion.
- **Action:** They commit to the "Domain Expertise" lane and volunteer for a complex infrastructure project to build a new "Future Paragraph."

**Example 2: The Job Offer Dilemma**
- **Context:** A PM is choosing between a "Logo" company (stable, prestigious) and a "Series B" startup (risky, high growth).
- **Application:** They look at "The Skip." Their goal is to be a CPO in five years.
- **Analysis:** The Logo company offers a "Lateral Move" but no new story. The Series B offers "Market Ambiguity" experience.
- **Decision:** They choose the Series B because it allows them to write a story about finding product-market fit, which is the missing piece for their CPO "Skip" goal.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Dismissing "Discarded" Feedback:** We often ignore feedback that contradicts our view of ourselves. These "anomalies" are usually where your growth is stuck.
- **Using "We" in Interviews:** When telling your story, saying "we did X" hides your specific contribution. Recruiters hire *you*, not your former team.
- **Chasing Labels over Skills:** Joining a FAANG/MAGMA company just for the logo is "short-term thinking." Only join if the specific role adds a new "Ambiguity Mastery" to your toolkit.
- **Creating "War" when Peace is Needed:** In late-career stages, people often create conflict just to feel the "grit" that made them successful in early stages. Recognize when you have "caught the rabbit" and need a new North Star.
