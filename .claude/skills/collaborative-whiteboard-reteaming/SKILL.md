description: A transparent process for planning and executing organizational changes by involving team members in the design. Use this when splitting a growing team, merging departments, or shifting strategic priorities where employee buy-in and "people-layer" alignment are critical for success.

Collaborative Whiteboard Reteaming treats organizational design as a visible, iterative process rather than a top-down secret. This approach reduces the anxiety associated with "reorgs" by providing transparency into the future state and allowing those affected to identify structural errors before they are finalized.

## 1. Establish Decision Clarity (The RIDE Framework)
Before opening the floor for discussion, define the roles in the decision-making process to avoid "design by committee" stalemates.

- **Request:** Who is initiating the change? (e.g., CTO, Head of Product)
- **Input:** Who provides feedback and identifies potential flaws? (e.g., ICs, Team Leads)
- **Decide:** Who has the final authority to sign off on the structure? (e.g., VPE)
- **Execute:** Who handles the logistics of the move? (e.g., HR, Engineering Managers)

## 2. The Whiteboard Process
Visualize the current and future state in a public or shared space (physical or digital).

### Create the Map
Map out the proposed structure using the following components:
- **Team Name/Mission:** A clear label and a 1-sentence purpose for the team.
- **Roles & Slots:** Every position required (e.g., 3 Backend, 1 Frontend, 1 PM).
- **Open Headcount:** Clearly mark which slots are currently unfilled to highlight growth opportunities.
- **Current Assignments:** Place names into the slots.

### Facilitate Input
1. **The Walkthrough:** Gather the team and present the "starting point" draft. Explicitly state: "This is a draft. We need your help to find the mistakes."
2. **The Feedback Window:** Time-box the feedback period (usually 1–3 days) to prevent distraction.
3. **Targeted Questions:** Ask team members to look for:
   - "Are we missing a critical dependency?"
   - "Is this team mission too broad or too narrow?"
   - "Does this alignment cause a knowledge silo?"
4. **Solicit Interest:** Allow individuals to signal interest in open slots or new missions that align with their career goals.

## 3. Manage the Three Phases of Transition
Use the William Bridges framework to shepherd the people through the emotional shift:
- **The Ending:** Acknowledge what is being lost (the old team dynamic, a specific project).
- **The Neutral Zone:** The "liminal space" where people aren't yet comfortable in the new structure. Provide extra support and frequent check-ins here.
- **The New Beginning:** Paint the vision of why the new structure is beneficial and anchor the team to the new mission.

## 4. Guidelines for Success
- **Time-box everything:** Bias toward shorter deliberation periods. Prolonged uncertainty is more damaging than an imperfect structure.
- **Focus on the "People Layer":** When adding new hires (One-by-One pattern), ensure the existing team is notified before the hire joins to prevent "surprise manager" syndrome.
- **Build Redundancy:** Use pair programming or shared ownership before a reorg. This "switching" makes it easier to move people without creating a single point of failure.

## Examples

**Example 1: Splitting a Bloated Platform Team**
- **Context:** A platform organization grows from 8 to 15 people. Standups are taking 45 minutes and no one knows what the others are doing.
- **Input:** Leadership proposes a split into "Infrastructure" and "Developer Experience."
- **Application:** The lead rolls out a whiteboard with names. An engineer points out that the "Database" expert is on Infrastructure, but Developer Experience needs them for 80% of their current roadmap.
- **Output:** The plan is adjusted to make the Database expert a shared consultant for two weeks before fully transitioning, preventing a project bottleneck.

**Example 2: The Strategic Pivot (Isolation Pattern)**
- **Context:** A company needs to build a totally new product line (e.g., "GoToMyPC") but the main team is bogged down by waterfall processes.
- **Input:** Use the whiteboard to "isolate" 4 people into a "Startup-within-the-Company."
- **Application:** The leader explicitly tells the rest of the org: "Do not disturb this team. They report directly to the CEO and have process freedom."
- **Output:** The isolated team moves to a daily sprint cadence, unencumbered by the main org's quarterly planning, and launches a MVP in 6 weeks.

## Common Pitfalls
- **The Percentage Trap:** Assigning people to multiple projects (e.g., 20% on Team A, 80% on Team B). Context switching kills productivity. Aim for 100% allocation to one team.
- **Spreading High Performers:** Breaking up a high-performing "band" to seed other teams. This often destroys the original team's "magic chemistry" without successfully transferring it to the others.
- **Opaque Departures:** People suddenly disappearing without a communication plan ("Poof, they're gone"). This triggers "who's next?" anxiety. Always provide a clear, honest narrative for departures.
- **The Stagnation Blind Spot:** Keeping a team together for 2+ years without changes. While "stability" sounds good, it often leads to knowledge silos and burnout. Use "Switching" as a tool for fulfillment.
