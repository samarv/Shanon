Power is a tool—like a hammer or a knife—that is necessary to get things done. This framework moves you from "judging" power to "doing" power by focusing on behavior and strategy rather than personality.

## The Seven Rules of Power

### 1. Get Out of Your Own Way
Stop self-sabotaging based on the desire to be liked or feelings of imposter syndrome.
*   **Prioritize competence over likability:** You are hired to get a job done, not to have a "cute personality."
*   **Eliminate pre-emptory apologies:** Never start a sentence with "I don't know if this will be useful" or "Pardon me for interrupting." If the comment isn't useful, don't say it. If it is, don't apologize for it.
*   **Assume you belong:** If you have the job, you are qualified. Acting otherwise invites others to doubt you.

### 2. Break the Rules
Rules are often created by those the current system favors. Breaking them makes you memorable and disruptive.
*   **Ask for what you want:** Most people never ask for help or opportunities because they fear rejection. Rejection leaves you no worse off than not asking.
*   **Differentiate through disruption:** Do things differently from the "industry incumbents" in your company to stand out.

### 3. Appear Powerful
People respond to how you look and sound before they process what you say.
*   **Master Body Language:** Use open postures, make direct eye contact, and use more gestures.
*   **Voice Control:** Speak with a louder, more confident volume. Use "disinhibited laughs" and humor to put people at ease while maintaining control.
*   **The "No Notes" Rule:** When presenting to senior leaders, do not read from notes. Mastery of the material without aids signals absolute command and authority.

### 4. Create a Powerful Brand
Visibility without substance is useless, but substance without visibility is a tragedy.
*   **Differentiate yourself:** Identify one unique trait (style, specific expertise, or a specific project) and lean into it.
*   **Scale your impact:** Use newsletters, podcasts, or internal forums to share your knowledge so people know who you are before you enter the room.

### 5. Network Relentlessly
Networking is the process of building a broad social network to gain non-redundant information.
*   **Become a Broker:** Connect people who have ideas with people who have money or resources. You gain power by being the central node in the exchange.
*   **Leverage Weak Ties:** Your close friends know the same things you do. Spend more time building ties with people outside your immediate circle/department to find new opportunities.

### 6. Use Your Power
Power is self-perpetuating. The more you use your authority to get things done, the more resources you will be given.
*   **Mobilize Resources:** Don't sit on your hands once you get a title. Use the authority to clear blockers for your team immediately.
*   **Associate with Success:** People are attracted to winners. Use your wins to recruit better talent and more budget.

### 7. Understand the Persistence of Power
Once you are successful, the methods you used to get there are often forgiven or forgotten.
*   **Focus on the outcome:** People want to be close to success and money. They will overlook your flaws or previous "rule-breaking" if you are currently delivering results.

## Implementation Exercises ("Doing Power")

*   **The "List of 10":** Write down 10 people who, if they knew you, would transform your career. For each person, identify one way to provide value to them (an article, a connection, or a helpful resource) and reach out.
*   **Personal Brand Statement:** Draft a 2-sentence description of what you want to be known for. Share it with 3 peers for feedback and iterate until it is distinct.
*   **The "Resource Creation" Project:** Identify a resource your organization needs (an award, a monthly report, a lunch-and-learn series) and start it. Own the resource to own the influence it generates.

## Examples

**Example 1: The Disrupter**
*   **Context:** An individual contributor wants a job at a high-growth startup but is being ignored.
*   **Application:** Instead of sending another resume (following the rules), they begin signing up partnerships or building features for the company externally.
*   **Output:** The founder notices the results and hires the person because they are already "doing" the job.

**Example 2: The Social Broker**
*   **Context:** A PM wants to move into a leadership role but only knows their immediate engineering team.
*   **Application:** They host a monthly "cross-functional dinner" where they invite one person from Sales, one from Legal, and one from Design.
*   **Output:** The PM becomes the "central node" for information across departments, making them the natural choice for a leadership role that requires cross-functional alignment.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **The Likability Trap:** Prioritizing being liked over being respected. To fix this, ask: "Am I avoiding this difficult decision because I'm worried about someone's feelings, or because it's the wrong move for the goal?"
*   **The "Sunday School" Mindset:** Assuming the world works the way it "should" rather than how it "is." Power is a tool; use it for good, but don't ignore the tool's existence.
*   **Waiting for Permission:** Successful people often ask for forgiveness, not permission. If you wait for a formal invitation to lead, it may never come.
*   **Judgmentalism:** Judging people on your "critical path" as immoral or incompetent. If they are necessary for your success, your only judgment should be: "They are on my critical path; how do I build a relationship to get this done?"
