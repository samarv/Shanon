description: A relationship-first framework for identifying, attracting, and landing high-caliber product leadership. Use this when hiring your first senior product leader, building a talent pipeline before an active need, or transitioning away from transactional, low-success recruiting methods.

This framework shifts hiring from a reactive "search for a shiny object" to a proactive cultivation of "step-up" talent. It prioritizes long-term rapport and market pulse over transactional outreach.

## Phase 1: Establish the Market Pulse
Never start a search from zero. You must understand "what good looks like" before you have an active headcount.

*   **Continuous Mapping:** Keep a running list of companies that are thriving in your sector or adjacent ones (e.g., "The Amazon Prime team circa 2018").
*   **No-Agenda Chats:** Reach out to 2-3 top-tier leaders monthly with the specific script: *"No agenda, I'm not trying to hire you tomorrow, I just want to know great people and pick your brain on the market."*
*   **The "Lieutenant" Strategy:** Don't just look for the CPO or Head of Product. Look for the breakout performers within high-growth teams who have a "chip on their shoulder" and something to prove.

## Phase 2: Define the "Step-Up" Profile
Avoid "Shiny Object Syndrome"—hiring a big-name executive from a giant corporation who is now too far from the tactical work.

*   **Identify the Spike:** Determine if the role requires a Major in Design, a Major in Infrastructure/Platform, or a Major in Growth. Do not hire a "Unicorn" to do everything; it leads to failure.
*   **Seek Hungry Talent:** Prioritize individuals who are currently operating one level below the role you are hiring for but are ready to lead.
*   **The 90-Day vs. 2-Year Test:**
    *   **90 Days:** What specific tactical outcome must they achieve immediately? (e.g., "Ship the ads platform MVP").
    *   **2 Years:** What does success look like through an IPO or major scale event?

## Phase 3: The Courtship Process
High-level talent rarely moves for a cold LinkedIn message. Use a "Long-Game" courtship (often 6-12 months).

1.  **Low-Stakes Involvement:** Invite the candidate to advise on a specific product problem or organizational structure.
2.  **Collaborative Mapping:** Ask the candidate: *"If you were building this team, who are the three best people you've ever worked with?"* This builds rapport without the pressure of an interview.
3.  **The "Non-Transactional" Touchpoint:** Follow their career milestones (vesting dates, speaking engagements) and reach out with genuine interest, not just a job offer.
4.  **The Final Push:** Transition from advisor to candidate only after trust is established.

## Phase 4: Ruthless Vetting
Vetting for product leaders requires looking past the resume "logos" to find actual fingerprints.

### The Backchannel Strategy
Never rely solely on provided references.
*   Find 3-5 people who worked cross-functionally with the candidate (Engineering, Design, Marketing).
*   **The "Skin in the Game" Question:** Ask the reference: *"Would you endorse this person if you knew your own professional reputation was attached to the recommendation?"*
*   **The "Why Not" Question:** *"Why would I NOT hire this person? What are the specific conditions where they struggle?"*

### Real-Time Recruiter Vetting
If hiring a search firm or internal recruiter, test them with these two steps:
1.  **The Echo Test:** Explain your needs and ask them to recite it back. If they can't capture the nuance of the "spike" you need, they will bring the wrong candidates.
2.  **The Brainstorm Test:** Ask them on the spot: *"Who are three people you would call tomorrow for this role?"* If they need a week to build a deck, they don't have the network pulse.

## Examples

**Example 1: Landing a "Whale" through advising**
*   **Context:** A Series B startup needs a VP of Engineering/Product.
*   **Application:** The founder reaches out to a senior leader at a top-tier firm (e.g., Snap or Amazon) for "advice" on their technical roadmap. Over seven months, the leader provides informal feedback.
*   **Output:** The leader becomes so invested in the product's success that they eventually join full-time, having already built a rapport that bypassed the formal "interview jitters."

**Example 2: Identifying the "Step-Up" candidate**
*   **Context:** A founder is tempted to hire a retired CPO from a legacy tech giant.
*   **Application:** Instead, the founder identifies the PM Lead at a high-growth mid-stage company who just shipped a major needle-moving feature.
*   **Output:** They hire the PM Lead as "Head of Product." This person is still "in the weeds," hungry to prove they can lead an entire function, and costs significantly less in equity/cash than the legacy CPO.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Logo Collecting:** Assuming someone is great just because they worked at "Google." They might have just "ridden the wave" without moving the needle.
*   **Talk-Down Interviews:** Candidates who blame Engineering or Design for missed deadlines. Product leaders must own the outcome regardless of the cross-functional friction.
*   **Title Inflation:** Giving a "CPO" title too early. Start with "Head of Product" to allow for growth and avoid the pain of a future demotion if you need to hire over them.
*   **Transactional Outreach:** Sending cold "We are hiring" messages to people who are clearly mid-vest or deep in a project. It signals you haven't done your homework.
