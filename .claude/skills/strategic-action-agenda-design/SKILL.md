description: Create a high-stakes strategy by identifying the "crux" of a problem and designing a set of coherent actions to overcome it. Use this when a team is overwhelmed by a "laundry list" of 10+ priorities, when a product lacks a clear competitive edge, or when high-level goals (e.g., "grow 20%") are being mistaken for an actual plan.

A good strategy is not a list of goals or a mission statement; it is a design for overcoming a specific high-stakes challenge. By focusing on an "Action Agenda" rather than abstract vision, you transform strategy from a document into a problem-solving engine.

## The Strategy Kernel
Every effective strategy must contain these three elements. If one is missing, it is "bad strategy."

### 1. The Diagnosis
Identify the nature of the challenge. A great diagnosis simplifies the complexity of reality by identifying certain aspects of the situation as critical.
*   **Ask the "Hard" Question:** Continually ask, "What makes this hard?" to push past surface-level observations.
*   **Identify the Crux:** Find the most difficult part of the challenge that is also **addressable**. If you cannot overcome the crux, you cannot succeed in the mission.
*   **Address Value Denial:** Identify what customers should be able to get but currently cannot (e.g., a window that lets in air but filters out city noise).

### 2. The Guiding Policy
Create an overall approach for overcoming the obstacles identified in the diagnosis.
*   **Leverage Asymmetry:** Identify a source of power you have that others don't.
    *   *Network Effects:* The product becomes more valuable as more people use it.
    *   *Reputation:* Using established trust to enter a new vertical.
    *   *Specialized Knowledge:* Knowing a technical or market nuance that competitors overlook.
*   **Focus Power:** Like a magnifying glass focusing sunlight, the policy must concentrate resources on a single objective rather than diffusing them across many.

### 3. Coherent Action
Define a set of steps to carry out the guiding policy.
*   **Avoid Contradictions:** Ensure actions do not fight each other (e.g., you cannot "increase profit margins" while simultaneously "aggressively cutting prices to gain market share").
*   **Create an Action Agenda:** List the 2-3 key things the team will *do* over the next 6–12 months. If the list has 17 items, it is not a strategy; it is a laundry list.

## Workflow for Building the Agenda

1.  **List Ambitions:** Write down everything you wish would happen (e.g., "be the #1 platform," "double revenue").
2.  **Filter for the Crux:** Review the ambitions and identify which ones have a clear, addressable barrier. Choose the one that, if solved, unlocks the most value.
3.  **Perform the Diagnosis:** Ask:
    *   Why haven't we solved this yet?
    *   What are the underlying organizational or market forces at play?
    *   What do we know that others don't?
4.  **Draft the Guiding Policy:** Write a one-sentence directive on how to handle the crux (e.g., "We will win by becoming the easiest platform to integrate with, even if it limits our custom feature set").
5.  **Assign Coherent Actions:** Define the 2–3 specific workstreams that will execute this policy. Ensure "Bob is in charge of X" and "Joan is in charge of Y."

## Examples

**Example 1: Microsoft’s AI Strategy**
*   **Diagnosis:** AI is a paradigm shift that threatens traditional search and office productivity.
*   **Guiding Policy:** Rapidly incorporate leading-edge LLM capabilities into the existing ecosystem rather than building every model from scratch.
*   **Actions:** Invest heavily in OpenAI; integrate Copilot into the Office Suite; update Bing to include chat-based search.

**Example 2: A Local Restaurant**
*   **Diagnosis:** High failure rates for new restaurants due to generic menus and high overhead.
*   **Guiding Policy:** Leverage a "celebrity chef" reputation to focus exclusively on a high-end, limited-seating tasting menu to ensure 100% inventory utilization.
*   **Actions:** Secure a 10-seat venue; hire the specific sous-chef from a Michelin-star background; launch with a pre-paid reservation model only.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Mistaking Goals for Strategy:** Statements like "Our strategy is to grow 30%" are ambitions, not strategies. A strategy explains *how* you will achieve that growth.
*   **Strategy Fluff:** Avoid "word salad"—high-level, abstract language that sounds strategic but contains no specific direction.
*   **The "17 Priorities" Trap:** Trying to do everything is a failure to choose. Strategy requires saying "No" to good ideas to focus on the essential one.
*   **Missing Action:** A strategy that doesn't result in specific people doing specific things is just a daydream. If no one's daily work changes, you don't have a strategy.
