# The Manager README for Scaling Trust

This skill allows you to "scale yourself" by documenting your leadership style, expectations, and personal quirks. In high-growth environments where headcount doubles or triples annually, a written manual provides immediate clarity, reduces the "getting to know you" friction, and creates a safe space for radical candor.

## Core Components of the README

A high-impact manager manual should be broken into three primary sections:

### 1. Expectations and Success Traits
Define what "good" looks like in your organization to remove ambiguity.
- **Values in Action:** Don't just list values; describe behaviors. (e.g., "Customer obsession means doing deliveries yourself to find bugs.")
- **The Bar for Quality:** Be explicit about what traits you value most (e.g., bias for action, intellectual curiosity, humility).
- **Communication Norms:** Detail your preferred channels (Slack for quick updates, email for deep dives) and expected response times.

### 2. Personal Operating Manual (The "Keith" Section)
Be ruthlessly transparent about your flaws and how to navigate them.
- **Personal Quirks:** Admit to your "bugs." (e.g., "I am a litigator by training; I tend to argue about things even if I agree with you just to test the level of conviction.")
- **How to Give You Feedback:** Lower the barrier for upward feedback. Explicitly state that you expect to be challenged.
- **The T3 B3 Framework:** Implement a "Top 3, Bottom 3" pulse check.
    - **T3:** Top 3 things the manager is doing well.
    - **B3:** Bottom 3 (constructive) things the manager needs to improve.

### 3. Commitments to the Team
State exactly what the team can expect from you in return for their performance.
- **The "Career-First" Promise:** Commitment to the individual's long-term career, even if it leads them away from the company.
- **1:1 Structure:** Reserve specific time for career coaching. (e.g., "The last 10 minutes of every 1:1 are dedicated solely to your professional development.")
- **Resource Protection:** Your commitment to getting them the tools they need and getting out of their way once they are enabled.

## Implementation Guide

1.  **Draft the Document:** Write the first version focusing on your "bugs" and your "non-negotiables."
2.  **Request "Bug Reports" from Peers:** Ask current colleagues if your self-assessment of your flaws is accurate.
3.  **Deploy to New Hires:** Send the document during the offer stage or on Day 1. Use it as an "icebreaker" for the first 1:1.
4.  **Action the Feedback:** When someone uses the "Bottom 3" to give you feedback, thank them enthusiastically and report back in the next 1:1 on what you changed.

## Examples

**Example 1: Managing a High-Stakes Conflict**
- **Context:** A PM and a Designer are stuck in a deadlock over a feature.
- **Input:** The PM has read the Manager's README, which states: "I value steel-manning. If we are stuck, I will ask you to argue the other person's side."
- **Application:** Instead of escalating for a "decide for us" meeting, the PM asks the Designer to swap roles for 10 minutes to argue the opposing case, as per the manager's documented framework.
- **Output:** The team reaches a compromise without needing a tie-breaker, increasing velocity.

**Example 2: Receiving Hard Upward Feedback**
- **Context:** A Director of Engineering feels their manager (the CEO) is being too "curt" in meetings, making the team nervous.
- **Input:** The CEO’s README says: "I know I can be aloof when I'm focused on numbers. Use T3 B3 to call me out."
- **Application:** In their 1:1, the Director says, "For my B3 today, you seemed dismissive in the sprint review. It’s making the devs hesitant to share bad news."
- **Output:** The CEO thanks them, acknowledges the "bug," and sends a Slack to the team clarifying their intent, reinforcing the culture of trust.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Treating it as Static:** A README is a living document. If you get feedback that you've developed a new bad habit, add it to the "Personal Operating Manual" section.
- **Lack of Action:** If you ask for constructive feedback via the T3 B3 framework but never change your behavior, the team will stop being honest. You must demonstrate that "feedback is a gift" by actioning it.
- **Using it as an Excuse:** Don't use "I'm just an asshole, it's in my README" as a shield. The goal of documenting a flaw is to provide a roadmap for others to help you fix it or navigate around it while you work on it.
- **Ignoring the "Next Job" Conversation:** Managers often fear talking about their reports leaving. Avoiding this prevents the transparency needed to plan for backfills and creates "surprise" departures.
