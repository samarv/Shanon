description: A framework for auditing existing solutions and rebuilding products from atomic building blocks rather than historical compromises. Use this when a project feels like a "me-too" version of a competitor, when a major technology shift occurs (e.g., AI/LLMs), or when your product is stuck in a local maximum.

First principles thinking allows you to bypass the "path dependence" that traps most companies into building slightly better versions of existing, mediocre solutions. By deriving products from atomic building blocks, you create "exothermic" energy that leads to step-function improvements rather than marginal gains.

## The First Principles Derivation Process

### 1. Map the Path Dependence
Analyze why the current status quo exists. Every product is a series of compromises based on what was true at the time of its creation.
- Identify the "Byzantine logic" in existing solutions.
- List the technical or regulatory constraints that existed 5–10 years ago.
- Determine which of those constraints are no longer true today.

### 2. Audit for "Overfitting"
Determine if the current solution has over-optimized for a proxy metric (Goodhart’s Law) rather than the actual user goal.
- **RFP/Sales Overfitting:** Is the software optimized to win a procurement checklist (feature bloat) or to be used effectively?
- **Metric Overfitting:** Has a KPI (like conversion rate) become the goal at the expense of unquantifiable value like "delight" or "trust"?
- **Goal:** Identify the 80% of value that is "unaddressable" by people who only look at quantifiable metrics.

### 3. Reset to Atomic Building Blocks
Ignore how others solve the problem. Look at the "physics" (atomic bits) of the problem as it stands *today*.
- Identify the "Booleans" (foundational assumptions) of the current model.
- If a foundational Boolean has flipped (e.g., "Computers can now understand intent" vs. "Computers only understand keywords"), you must rerun the entire logic tree.
- Re-derive the solution using the most modern "composability" of building blocks (e.g., modern APIs, LLMs, or distribution channels).

### 4. Play the Positional Game
While tactics (A/B tests, minor tweaks) prevent you from "dying," the positional game wins the market.
- **Positional Moves:** Build trust, simplify complex UX (e.g., "autopiloting" taxes), and align your business model so you win only when the customer wins.
- **Decision Heuristic:** Ask, "What is the decision our future selves would want us to have made 20 years ago?"

## The Tobi Tornado: Execution
When a first-principles derivation reveals that a current project is on the wrong path, execute a "Tobi Tornado" to compress change management.
- **Kill the Sunk Cost:** Immediately stop work on the inferior version.
- **Founder the Next Version:** Re-assign the team not as "people whose project was cancelled," but as "founders of the next, correct version."
- **Compress Time:** Move with "whiplash" speed to move the entire company from the old logic tree to the new one.

## Examples

**Example 1: Shopify’s Tax Logic**
- **Context:** Competitor software had complex tax configuration screens because "taxes are complex."
- **First Principles Derivation:** The building blocks (modern tax rate databases and geolocation) meant software could now calculate this automatically.
- **Application:** Instead of building a better "Tax Settings" page, Shopify removed the need for the page entirely by "autopiloting" the calculation.
- **Result:** Lowered the "courage threshold" for new entrepreneurs, leading to more businesses being created.

**Example 2: The Remote-Work Decision**
- **Context:** Shopify was an "office-first" company with high-end real estate.
- **The Boolean Flip:** COVID-19 changed the foundational assumption "Are people allowed to leave the house?" from TRUE to FALSE.
- **Derivation:** Tobi rerun the "location strategy" function. If the office is no longer a tool for "happy accidents," the most competitive move is to hire talent anywhere globally.
- **Result:** Instead of a "hybrid" compromise (local maximum), they committed to being remote-only to access a 100x larger talent pool.

## Common Pitfalls
- **Valuing Consistency over Correctness:** Sticking to a plan because "we said we would" is an abdication of leadership. Change your mind the moment the facts change.
- **Ignoring the "Aesthetics of Sophistication":** Dismissing "fun" or "delight" as naive. In reality, these unquantifiables are often the leading indicators of future metric growth.
- **Defaulting to the Status Quo:** Building a "good version" of a competitor’s product. If you do the same thing as everyone else, it is axiomatically impossible to be world-class.
- **Lack of Courage:** Choosing "Path B" (convenience) over "Path A" (conviction) because Path A is harder to explain to stakeholders.
