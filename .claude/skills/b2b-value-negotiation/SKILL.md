# B2B Value Negotiation and Pricing Defense

The goal of B2B negotiation is not to win on price, but to extract full value for the innovation you provide. Instead of reactive discounting, use a structured "give-and-get" approach to maintain pricing power while ensuring the customer recognizes the ROI.

## 1. Master the "Give and Get" Framework
Never grant a concession without receiving something of value in return. This maintains authenticity and signals that your pricing is rooted in value, not arbitrary margins.

### The "Value Audit" Get
If a customer demands a discount, ask for a **Value Audit** in exchange.
- **The Ask:** "I can grant this 10% concession, but in exchange, your team must commit to a joint value assessment every six months."
- **The Benefit:** This forces the customer to document the value they receive, creating a pre-validated business case for future renewals and price increases.

### Top B2B "Gets" to Request:
- **Case Studies/Testimonials:** Commitment to a public-facing success story.
- **Contract Length:** Extending a 1-year contract to 2 or 3 years.
- **Payment Terms:** Net-15 or upfront annual payment instead of quarterly.
- **Volume Commitments:** Guaranteed minimum usage levels.

## 2. Execute Value Selling
Shift the conversation from product features to business outcomes using three tactical loops.

### Create the Need
Don't just discover needs; create them by highlighting the "cost of inaction."
- **Script:** "Your current process takes three weeks to generate these reports. If that data were available instantaneously, how would that change your marketing team's weekly output?"

### Affirmation Loops
Force the customer to articulate the value back to you throughout the demo.
- **Question:** "Based on what you've seen, how specifically do you see this dashboard impacting your team's efficiency?"
- **Goal:** Once they agree there is value, it becomes much harder for them to push back on price later.

### Co-Create the ROI Model
Never show up with a pre-made ROI slide. Co-create it during the Proof of Concept (POC) so the customer owns the assumptions.
- **Bucket 1: Incremental Gains:** Revenue growth, improved churn, or higher conversion.
- **Bucket 2: Cost Savings:** Headcount reduction, retired legacy license costs.
- **Bucket 3: Opportunity Cost:** What the team can achieve with the hours saved (e.g., "If we save you 10 hours, what is the value of the next-best project those engineers can tackle?").

## 3. Advanced Tactical Maneuvers

### Show Options (Good-Better-Best)
Never present a single price. Presenting options shifts the negotiation from "Yes/No on price" to "Which value level is right for us?"
- **The Courage Hack:** If your target price is $100k but you think they have more budget, offer:
    1. $100k base.
    2. $500k fixed (for full value).
    3. $100k + 10% of incremental value generated.
- This forces a conversation about the $500k value rather than haggling the $100k down to $80k.

### Taper Concessions
If you must discount, decrease the size of the discount with each round to signal you are reaching your limit.
- **Wrong:** 5% then 5% then 5% (signals you have infinite margin).
- **Right:** 10% then 3% then 1% (signals the "well is dry").

### Anchoring with ROI
When pushed for a budget range early, anchor on the value delivered, not the cost.
- **Script:** "For companies your size, we typically unlock $10M in value. Our pricing model is designed to deliver a 10x ROI, so we'd be looking at roughly $1M to achieve those results."

## Examples

**Example 1: Defending Price Against a "Tire-Kicker"**
- **Context:** A prospect wants a free 60-day pilot of an AI marketing tool.
- **Input:** Prospect says, "We just want to see if it works before we talk budget."
- **Application:** Apply the **Lead Qualification** tactic. Charge a nominal fee for the POC (e.g., $10k).
- **Output:** Frame the fee as: "This $10k covers the cost of co-creating a formal business case. If the ROI model we build together doesn't show a 10x return, we won't move to a commercial deal."

**Example 2: Negotiating a 50% Price Increase**
- **Context:** An existing SaaS customer is on a legacy "seat-based" plan that is now underpriced relative to the AI value they get.
- **Input:** Customer objects to a price hike.
- **Application:** Use the **Value Audit** and **Opportunity Cost** buckets.
- **Output:** "Over the last 12 months, our tool automated 500 hours of manual QA. At your internal developer rate, that saved $75k in labor. We are increasing the price by $10k to continue supporting that automation, which still leaves you with a 7x return on that specific feature."

## Common Pitfalls
- **The Prayer Session:** Holding hands and "praying" a customer accepts a 10% price increase. If you are afraid to raise prices, you haven't established pricing power or proven attribution.
- **The "Land and Give Away the Farm":** Giving away the most valuable 20% of features for free to "land" the customer, leaving nothing of value to upsell later.
- **Reactive Discounting:** Dropping the price the moment a procurement officer asks. This trains the customer to never pay full price.
- **Technical POCs:** Treating a POC as a "test to see if it works." A POC's only goal is to build a business case. If it’s just a technical test, you lose your commercial leverage.
