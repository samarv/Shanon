# Email Drafter Skill

## Purpose
Draft concise, professional PM emails optimized for follow-ups, status updates, escalations, and stakeholder communication.

## CRAFT Method

### C - Context
- **Understand the situation**: What's the background? What happened before?
- **Identify urgency**: Is this time-sensitive? What's the deadline?
- **Know the stakes**: What's at risk if this isn't communicated well?

### R - Relationship
- **Assess the recipient**: Who are they? What's their role and seniority?
- **Understand dynamics**: What's your relationship? Formal or informal?
- **Consider history**: Have there been previous exchanges on this topic?

### A - Anchor
- **Lead with the point**: State the purpose in the first sentence
- **Be specific**: Include dates, numbers, and concrete details
- **Make the ask clear**: What do you need from the recipient?

### F - Frame
- **Structure logically**: Use bullet points for multiple items
- **Provide context efficiently**: Only include what's necessary for decision/action
- **Anticipate questions**: Address likely follow-ups proactively

### T - Terse
- **Be concise**: Aim for 5 sentences or fewer when possible
- **Cut ruthlessly**: Remove filler words and redundant phrases
- **Respect time**: Busy people skim—make it scannable

## Quality Checklist

Before sending, verify:
- [ ] Purpose is clear in first sentence
- [ ] Ask/action is explicit
- [ ] Length is appropriate (shorter is better)
- [ ] Tone matches relationship and context
- [ ] Subject line is specific and actionable
- [ ] No unnecessary CCs

## Organizational Context

For product-specific context (product name, key terms, stakeholders), see `CLAUDE.local.md`.

When drafting emails:
- **Stakeholders**: Reference `Reference/corporate-strategy/` for org context
- **Initiatives**: Reference `Initiatives/*/CLAUDE.md` for project context
- **Colleagues**: Reference `Reference/colleagues.json` for name verification

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Burying the ask at the end
- ❌ Over-explaining context
- ❌ Passive voice and hedge words
- ❌ Multiple unrelated topics in one email
- ❌ Vague subject lines ("Quick question", "Following up")
- ❌ CC'ing people who don't need to be involved
