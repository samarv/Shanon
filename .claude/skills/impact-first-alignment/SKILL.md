name: impact-first-alignment
description: A framework to align product team activities with business-critical outcomes. Use this when setting quarterly goals, justifying team headcount to leadership, or prioritizing a backlog to avoid the "low-impact death spiral."

The "Low Impact Death Spiral" occurs when teams focus on cosmetic features (the "rhinestones") rather than the core engine of the business. To avoid being seen as "work around the work" during layoffs or budget cuts, you must align every team activity to top-line business success.

## The CEO Stress Test
Before beginning any planning cycle, ask your team: **"If you were the CEO of this company, would you fully fund your own team?"**

If you cannot answer with a confident "Yes" based on the commercial value you provide, you are in a high-risk position. Use the following three steps to move from "feature factory" to "impact-first."

## Step 1: Set Goals "One Step Away" from the Company
Stop cascading goals through ten layers of abstraction. Your team goal should have a direct, mathematical relationship to the company’s top-line objective (Revenue, Growth, or Profit).

1.  **Identify the Center of Gravity**: Start with the primary company goal (e.g., $100M ARR).
2.  **Determine the Value Exchange**: Identify the specific user behavior that creates that value. 
3.  **Use One Mathematical Operator**: Ensure your team goal is only one formula step away from the company goal.
    *   *Bad Goal*: "Improve the user onboarding experience." (Too many steps to revenue).
    *   *Good Goal*: "Increase the rate of users who successfully send their first email." (Directly leads to retention/revenue).

## Step 2: Maintain Impact-First Focus Daily
Do not file your goals away after "OKR season." Integrate the impact metric into every artifact.

*   **Epics & PRDs**: Every document must start with: "This work contributes [X amount] to our goal of [Team Impact Metric]."
*   **The "One Sentence" Rule**: Every team member should be able to say: "I feel awesome about our work this year because we drove [X specific impact] for the business."
*   **Subtract, Don't Just Add**: If a feature or step in a user flow does not contribute to the impact metric, remove it to reduce the "weight" of the product.

## Step 3: Use Identical Units for Prioritization
When using prioritization frameworks (like ICE or RICE), replace arbitrary "Impact Scores" (1-10) with the actual unit of your goal.

1.  **Define the Unit**: If your goal is "100,000 new users," your impact estimation unit is "New Users."
2.  **Estimate the Contribution**:
    *   Feature A: Estimated to drive 500 new users.
    *   Feature B: Estimated to drive 50,000 new users.
3.  **Address the "High Effort" Bias**: Often, the only features that can actually hit the goal are high-effort and complex (e.g., a total onboarding redesign vs. a landing page tweak). Be brave enough to prioritize the high-effort work if the low-effort work has zero chance of moving the needle significantly.

## Handling Stakeholders with Options
Never say a flat "No" to an executive request. Instead, present the trade-offs in the context of impact.

1.  **Present 3 Options**: Show the requested feature alongside the impact-first work.
2.  **Show the Impact Adjustment**: "If we build [Executive Request], we will have to adjust our [Impact Metric] projection down by [X amount] because of the resource shift."
3.  **Provide a Recommendation**: Always advocate for the path that maximizes the business-critical outcome.

## Examples

**Example 1: Growth Team**
*   **Context**: Company goal is 1 million new users.
*   **Input**: The team is considering a series of small UI tweaks to the sign-up button.
*   **Application**: The PM asks, "How many of the 1M users will this drive?" The estimate is 2,000. The team realizes they need a bigger bet. They pivot to an "Onboarding Personalization" project estimated to drive 200,000 users.
*   **Output**: A prioritized roadmap focused on the 200k user bet, even though it requires cross-team dependency management.

**Example 2: AdTech Platform Team**
*   **Context**: Company needs to grow profit from £20M to £100M.
*   **Input**: The team is currently building a "magical, beautiful platform" with no specific launch date.
*   **Application**: The team maps the timeline. If they launch in October, they only have 5 months to make £80M. They realize they must "commercialize sooner" by launching individual modules in May.
*   **Output**: A phased release plan that starts generating profit 5 months earlier than the original "big bang" relaunch.

## Common Pitfalls
*   **Sweating the "Middle"**: Spending weeks perfecting the wording of OKRs or the "strategy" while losing sight of the actual revenue/growth target.
*   **The Rhinestone Trap**: Adding "cool" features that look good in a demo but increase product complexity without moving a business metric.
*   **Proprietary Scoring**: Using complex internal formulas that stakeholders don't understand. If a CEO can't understand your prioritization logic in 30 seconds, it's too complex.
*   **Avoiding Accountability**: Choosing "defensible" work (things you can definitely ship) over "impactful" work (things that might fail but are necessary for the business).
