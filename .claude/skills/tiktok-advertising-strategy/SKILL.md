# TikTok Advertising & Creative Strategy

TikTok operates on a **Content Graph** rather than a People Graph (Meta) or Intent Graph (Google). Success requires moving from a "high-production/precision-targeting" mindset to a "high-velocity/authentic-discovery" model. Use this framework to leverage the algorithm's ability to drive word-of-mouth at scale.

## Core Principles

*   **TikTok-First, Not Platform-Agnostic:** Do not repurpose polished ads from other platforms. TikTok users reward "unfiltered" and "imperfect" content that feels like organic participation in the community.
*   **Discovery over Precision:** Trust the algorithm to find your audience. Over-refining your targeting (niche remarketing) early on limits the machine's ability to discover new customer segments.
*   **The 10x Velocity Rule:** The primary lever for success is creative volume. Aim to test at least 10 unique creatives per week.

## Execution Workflow

### 1. Establish Organic Presence
Before spending, create a Business Account to understand the "heat" of the platform.
*   **Seed the Algorithm:** Post organic content to identify which hooks or themes resonate.
*   **Listen to the Community:** Use the "TikTok Made Me Buy It" trend and the Creative Center to identify what formats are currently driving actions.

### 2. Develop "Unfiltered" Creative
Shift from high production value to high relatability.
*   **Master the Hook:** The first 2 seconds must stop the scroll. Use relatable personal life situations or "hacks."
*   **Embrace Imperfection:** Use tools like CapCut to create videos that look and feel like they were made by an individual, not a brand.
*   **Leverage Trends:** Connect your product to existing memes, sounds, or cultural moments (e.g., Duolingo’s use of the "annoying" owl mascot).

### 3. Implement High-Velocity Testing
Run a "Test and Learn" cycle for at least one month before judging ROI.
*   **The Weekly Sprint:** Launch 10+ different creatives per week.
*   **Variable Testing:** Test different hooks for the same product, or different creators for the same script.
*   **Evaluate on Full-Funnel Impact:** Look beyond brand awareness; measure how discovery leads to "TikTok Made Me Buy It" conversion behavior.

### 4. Optimize Targeting for the Content Graph
Avoid the mistake of niche targeting at the start.
*   **Use Broad Targeting:** Set your initial campaigns with wide parameters to allow the algorithm to "explore" the market.
*   **Scaling Success:** Only after the algorithm identifies a high-performing segment should you begin to refine or use geo-splitting/AB testing.

## Examples

**Example 1: SaaS/App Growth**
*   **Context:** A language learning app wants to drive new user installs.
*   **Input:** High-quality studio ads showing the interface.
*   **Application:** Pivot to "unfiltered" content. Create 10 videos per week showing creators making funny mistakes in their target language or celebrating a 30-day "streak."
*   **Output:** Lower CAC by tapping into the "relatability" factor that triggers organic sharing and downloads.

**Example 2: DTC Product Launch**
*   **Context:** A new consumer electronics brand launching a portable charger.
*   **Input:** Targeted remarketing to people who visited the website.
*   **Application:** Switch to Broad Targeting. Send the product to 10 micro-creators to film "pack with me" or "travel hacks" videos. Use the best-performing organic video as a Spark Ad.
*   **Output:** The algorithm discovers a "business traveler" segment the brand hadn't initially targeted, leading to a viral sales spike.

## Common Pitfalls

*   **The "Meta Mindset":** Bringing rigid, black-and-white discipline to TikTok. Don't cap your creative team into a box; encourage them to be "always curious" and test wacky ideas.
*   **Premature Optimization:** Cutting spend after 1 week. The algorithm requires a "learning curve" (minimum 1 month) to calibrate the content graph to your specific product.
*   **Niche Targeting Too Early:** Restricting the audience so much that the algorithm can't "feel the heat" of the broader market.
*   **Over-Production:** Spending $20k on one "perfect" ad instead of $2k each on 10 "authentic" ads. On TikTok, quantity of ideas often leads to quality of results.
