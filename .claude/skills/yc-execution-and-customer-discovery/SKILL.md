# YC Execution and Customer Discovery Framework

This framework is designed to eliminate "fake work" and refocus early-stage teams on the only two things that matter: building product and talking to users. It utilizes the specific questioning and accountability methods used by Y Combinator partners to drive startup progress.

## The Execution Loop (Office Hours Pattern)

Stop giving general status updates. Use these specific questions to uncover hidden blockers and maintain a bi-weekly momentum.

### Individual Velocity Check
Ask this question to yourself or your team weekly:
**"What is holding us back from moving faster right now?"**
- Do not accept "strategy" or "long-term planning" as an answer.
- Focus on immediate friction: technical debt, lack of leads, fear of a specific conversation, or unclear priorities.
- Force a crystallization of the single most important task.

### The Bi-Weekly Accountability Sprint
In a group or team setting, track progress using these three data points:
1. **The Retrospective:** What were the goals for the last two weeks? Did we hit them?
2. **The Root Cause:** If we missed a goal, exactly what came in the way? (Be ruthlessly honest).
3. **The Forward Goal:** What are the specific, measurable goals for the next two weeks?

## Tactical Customer Discovery

Most founders fail because they are afraid of customer rejection. Use these tactics to gather high-signal data.

### The "Watch, Don't Ask" Method
Instead of asking customers what they want, observe their current pain.
- **Scenario:** If building an automation tool, have the user screen-share their daily workflow in Excel.
- **Signal:** Look for repetitive, manual tasks they don't even realize are "hard" because they've internalized the friction.
- **Principle:** Intensity of pain is discovered by watching a user's struggle, not by hearing their opinion.

### The Volume Rule
To find the 10% of users who are "early adopters," you must be willing to face 90% indifference.
- **Target Metrics:** Aim to talk to **25–50 potential customers** before finalizing a product direction.
- **Outreach Strategy:** You often need to reach 10 people to get 1 meeting. Plan your outreach volume accordingly.
- **The Indifference Mindset:** Internalize that users aren't "hating" your product; they are busy and indifferent. This gives you a "second chance" to reach out again in 6 months with a better version.

## The Strategy vs. Execution Spectrum
For early-stage products, strategy is often a distraction. 
- **The Rule:** Execution *is* the strategy until you have product-market fit.
- **The Focus:** Your "strategy" should simply be a list of priorities from top to bottom. Work on item #1 until it is done. Avoid "strategy sessions" that assume you can do multiple things at once.

## Examples

**Example 1: B2B SaaS Bottleneck**
- **Context:** A team is struggling to grow their user base despite a "good" product.
- **The Velocity Question:** "What's holding us back?"
- **The Discovery:** "We are afraid to call the 50 leads we generated because the UI isn't perfect."
- **Application:** Move from "perfecting UI" to a 2-week goal of "Call all 50 leads and watch them try to sign up."
- **Output:** Discovered that users couldn't find the 'Invite' button—a 5-minute fix that was more important than the UI polish.

**Example 2: Validating a New Hardware Concept**
- **Context:** A founder wants to build a new EV charging network.
- **Application:** Instead of a survey, the founder rents a non-Tesla EV and drives to 10 different charging stations to record the experience.
- **Observation:** The apps are fragmented and the payment flow fails 30% of the time.
- **Output:** Pivot from "better chargers" to "software that unifies the charging experience (Plaid for EV)."

## Common Pitfalls
- **Confusing Validation with Progress:** Thinking that getting accepted into an accelerator or raising a seed round equals Product-Market Fit. Only customer usage and "exciting new progress" every two weeks count.
- **Over-valuing Strategy:** Spending weeks on a "5-year roadmap" when you haven't talked to 10 customers yet.
- **Asking Leading Questions:** Asking "Would you use this?" (Users say 'yes' to be nice). Instead, ask "How do you solve this today?" and "Show me the last time you did this."
- **Non-Technical Founder Isolation:** Trying to "spec" a product for a contractor. You cannot "spec" your way to a great product; you must be part of the iterative loop.
