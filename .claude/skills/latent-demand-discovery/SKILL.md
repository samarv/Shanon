description: Identify high-potential consumer product opportunities by observing "distortive" user behaviors where people use manual workarounds or non-native tools to satisfy a specific motivation. Use this when brainstorming new products, seeking "blue ocean" features, or validating product-market fit for a niche.

The "Latent Demand" framework is a method for identifying high-growth product opportunities by spotting where users are already exerting extreme effort to achieve a goal through inefficient means. When you find people going through a "distortive process" to obtain value, you have found the strongest possible signal for a new product.

## The Discovery Process

### 1. Identify Anomalous Success
Look for products or behaviors that succeed despite massive friction. This is the "Arabic App" signal.
- **Scan the charts for anomalies:** Look at the top of the App Store. Are there apps in foreign languages charting in your region? Are there apps with terrible UX that everyone is still using?
- **Analyze "Duct-Taped" Workflows:** Look for users jumping between 3-4 different apps to complete one task (e.g., taking a screenshot in one app, adding text in another, and posting to a third).
- **Observe Manual Social Games:** Watch platforms like Snapchat, TikTok, or Instagram for "manual" games users play (e.g., posting "tbh" templates and asking for emoji replies).

### 2. Isolate the "Distortive Process"
Ask: "What is the difficult, manual, or broken thing people are doing right now to get what they want?"
- **The Effort Test:** If a user is willing to use an app in a language they don't speak, or spend 10 minutes on a manual task that should take 5 seconds, the demand for that value is "latent" and intense.

### 3. Crystallize the Core Motivation
Identify the psychological "why" behind the behavior.
- Are they looking for anonymous disclosure?
- Are they seeking positive affirmation?
- Are they trying to save money on a specific high-intent purchase?
- **The Filter:** Distinguish between the *mechanism* (anonymous messaging) and the *motivation* (hearing good things about yourself).

### 4. Remove the Friction (Crystallize the UX)
Build the product that provides the "crystallized" version of that value by removing every unnecessary tap.
- **Invert Time-to-Value:** Aim for an "aha moment" in under 3 seconds.
- **Native Experience:** Turn the manual workaround into a single-button feature.

## Examples

**Example 1: The Affection Signal (tbh/Gas)**
- **Context:** Nikita noticed teens posting "tbh" (to be honest) templates on Snapchat and manually replying to friends with compliments. Simultaneously, Sarahah (an Arabic app) hit #1 in the US despite being in a foreign language.
- **Latent Demand:** Teens desperately wanted a vehicle for anonymous disclosure and positive affirmation.
- **Application:** Built an app (tbh) that provided pre-authored positive polls, removing the "distortive" manual typing and the risk of bullying.
- **Output:** A product that grew to millions of users in weeks because it crystallized a behavior that was already happening manually.

**Example 2: The E-commerce Shortcut (Dupe.com)**
- **Context:** Users were manually taking screenshots of expensive furniture, using Google Lens to find images, and then searching for cheaper "dupes."
- **Latent Demand:** High intent to find cheaper versions of specific luxury goods without the manual search "slop."
- **Application:** Created a tool where users simply type "dupe.com/" in front of any URL to find the cheaper version instantly.
- **Output:** Millions in ARR within 60 days by inverting the time-to-value for an existing manual behavior.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring the Negative Signal:** Just because an app is viral doesn't mean its *entire* model is good. (e.g., People liked the anonymity of Sarahah but hated the bullying; the "latent demand" was for the anonymity, not the toxicity).
- **Over-solving the Problem:** Adding too many features during the "crystallization" phase. If the demand is latent, you only need to solve the *one* thing they are currently doing manually.
- **Failing the "Miracle" Test:** If you have to explain the value to the user, it isn't latent demand. Latent demand products should feel like a "miracle" that solves a problem the user was already struggling with.
- **Scaling Before Density:** For social apps, even a great "latent demand" solution will fail without density. Test the solution in a high-density environment (like one specific school or office) to ensure the flywheel spins before going broad.
