# Shannon

**350+ proven PM frameworks from the best product leaders—applied automatically to your work.**

---

## Work Like the Best PMs Work

You're using generic AI. It doesn't know the difference between a PRD and a pitch deck. You explain Radical Candor every time you draft feedback. Your OKRs lack the rigor of Marty Cagan's empowered teams. Your positioning doesn't follow April Dunford's playbook.

**Shannon changes this.**

It's an AI system pre-loaded with 350+ frameworks from product leaders you already follow:
- **Shreyas Doshi** - First principles thinking, LNO prioritization
- **April Dunford** - Obviously Awesome positioning
- **Teresa Torres** - Opportunity Solution Trees, continuous discovery
- **Marty Cagan** - Empowered product teams
- **Kim Scott** - Radical Candor feedback
- **Ryan Singer** - Shape Up pitches
- **Geoffrey Moore** - Crossing the Chasm strategy
- **Lenny Rachitsky** - Growth frameworks, retention mechanics
- **Elena Verna** - PLG flywheels, activation optimization
- Plus 100+ more frameworks from top PMs, founders, and growth leaders

When you draft an email, **CRAFT method** applies. When you create a PRD, **Working Backwards PR/FAQ** structures it. When you prioritize tasks, **LNO framework** categorizes them. When you position your product, **April Dunford's 5-step process** guides you.

**No more explaining frameworks to AI. No more generic advice.**

Your outputs improve. Stakeholders notice. You're applying proven methodologies—automatically.

## Shannon in Action

### Draft Strategic Emails → CRAFT Method Activates

**You:** "Draft an email to my VP about the Q1 roadmap change"

**Shannon:**
```
Applying CRAFT method (Sam Lessin framework) for executive communication...

Subject: Q1 Roadmap Shift: Analytics Over Social

Sarah,

**Catch:** Our activation data shows 73% of new users churn before 
completing their first report. Analytics is the bottleneck.

**Reasoning:** Cutting social sharing (3 eng-weeks) to double-down 
on guided analytics. Trade-off: Social moves to Q2, but we reduce 
churn by 50% and unlock enterprise deals.

**Ask:** Your approval to communicate at Friday's all-hands.

**Follow-up:** If approved, I'll update eng team by EOD and draft 
messaging for your review Thursday.

**Timebox:** Need go/no-go by Wednesday EOD to stay on schedule.
```

✓ Executive-ready, structured, actionable—first draft.

### Create PRDs → Working Backwards PR/FAQ

**You:** "Create a PRD for collaboration features"

**Shannon:**
```
Using Amazon's Working Backwards framework. First, let me ask one 
eigenquestion to unlock clarity:

"Is this real-time collaboration (like Figma) or async review 
(like Google Docs comments)?"

[You answer: async review]

Perfect. Writing the PR/FAQ now...

# Press Release: Analytics Sharing & Feedback (Q1 2026)

Analytics Platform announces async collaboration...
[Full PR/FAQ with customer benefits, FAQs, success metrics]
```

✓ Customer-centric, validated approach before building.

### Prioritize Work → LNO Framework

**You:** "I have 15 tasks. What should I focus on?"

**Shannon:**
```
Applying LNO framework (Lenny Rachitsky):

🚀 LEVERAGE (Do first - 20% effort, 80% impact)
- L1: Finalize enterprise PRD (unblocks 8 eng-weeks)
- L2: Demo to VP (unblocks $1.2M in deals)
- L3: Resolve permissions blocker (3 deals waiting)

⚖️ NEUTRAL (Important but not urgent)
- N1: Update Q2 roadmap draft
- N2: Review designer mockups
[...]

🔻 OVERHEAD (Delegate or defer)
- O1: Reorganize Confluence docs → Defer to Q2
- O2: Update 47 Jira tickets → Delegate or skip
```

✓ Clear priorities based on Q1 objective.

### Position Product → April Dunford's Method

**You:** "Help me position our analytics tool against Tableau"

**Shannon:**
```
Using April Dunford's Obviously Awesome framework:

1. **Competitive Alternatives:** What customers use today
   - Tableau (enterprise BI)
   - Excel + manual reporting
   - Do nothing (status quo)

2. **Unique Attributes:** What you have that they don't
   - Real-time collaboration
   - No SQL required
   - Native integrations with your stack

3. **Value (translation):** Why those attributes matter
   - Teams align faster (real-time)
   - Marketers self-serve (no SQL)
   - Automated data refresh (native integrations)

4. **Target Segment:** Who cares most about this value
   - Mid-market SaaS companies (50-500 employees)
   - Marketing/Ops teams (non-technical)
   - Needs: Fast decisions, no data team dependency

5. **Market Category:** Context that makes your value obvious
   - "Collaborative Analytics for Non-Technical Teams"
   - NOT "Business Intelligence" (too enterprise)

Your positioning: "The Figma of Analytics—Real-time collaboration 
for teams who don't speak SQL."
```

✓ Differentiated positioning that wins deals.

### Give Feedback → Radical Candor

**You:** "Help me give feedback to Sarah about missed deadlines"

**Shannon:**
```
Applying Radical Candor (Kim Scott framework):

You need to Care Personally + Challenge Directly. Avoid Ruinous 
Empathy (being nice but not helpful).

**Script:**

"Sarah, can we talk about the Q4 timeline? [Care: show you value her]

You've missed 3 sprint commitments this quarter. This impacts the 
team's ability to hit our OKR. [Challenge: be direct about impact]

I want to understand what's blocking you and how I can help. 
[Care: genuinely interested in helping]

Is it capacity? Unclear requirements? Something else? Let's figure 
this out together so next quarter is different." 
[Challenge + Care: accountability with support]
```

✓ Respectful but direct—builds trust while solving problems.

### 3. Personal Context (Your Layer)
Shannon learns your name, role, product, team, preferences. 

You must create a file in .claude named CLAUDE.local.md using CLAUDE.local.example.md as a guide.


### 4. Content Pack (Optional Polish)
Add your company's brand themes, templates, writing voice. Shannon works great without it—adds 10% when you need it.

## Initiatives: Your Project Brain

Shannon treats each product initiative as a living, self-documenting workspace.

### What Are Initiatives?

An initiative is a folder in `Initiatives/` with its own `CLAUDE.md` file—a project brain that Shannon maintains automatically. Think of it as a senior PM shadowing your work, taking notes, tracking decisions, and maintaining context so nothing gets lost.

```
Initiatives/
├── collaboration-features/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md              # Auto-maintained project brain
│   ├── prd.md                 # Your PRD
│   ├── positioning.md         # April Dunford's framework applied
│   ├── pitch.md               # Shape Up pitch
│   └── research/
│       ├── user-interviews.md
│       └── competitive-analysis.md
│
└── enterprise-onboarding/
    ├── CLAUDE.md              # Separate project brain
    ├── prd.md
    └── metrics-dashboard.md
```

### How Initiative CLAUDE.md Works

Each initiative's `CLAUDE.md` is different from the system `.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

| File | Purpose | Maintained By |
|------|---------|---------------|
| `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Shannon's core instructions and methodology | You (rarely changes) |
| `Initiatives/[name]/CLAUDE.md` | Living context for this specific initiative | Shannon (auto-updates) |

**Initiative CLAUDE.md contains:**
- **Status & Timeline:** Current phase, target dates, dependencies
- **Core Objective:** One-sentence goal with success metrics
- **Key Decisions:** What was decided, why, what trade-offs were made
- **Documents Created:** Links to PRDs, pitches, research with dates
- **Current Blockers:** What's stuck and who owns unblocking it
- **Open Questions:** Unresolved decisions with owners and deadlines
- **Decision History:** Rationale for past choices (prevents rehashing)

### Setting Up an Initiative

**Method 1: Let Shannon Guide You**

```bash
# Create the folder
mkdir Initiatives/my-feature

# Open it in Cursor
cursor Initiatives/my-feature

# Shannon detects new initiative
"I see you're in a new initiative folder. Want me to create 
the CLAUDE.md project brain? I'll ask 3 questions to set it up."
```

Shannon asks:
1. What's the one-sentence objective?
2. What's the target timeline?
3. What success metrics matter?

Creates `CLAUDE.md` automatically.

**Method 2: Manual Setup**

```bash
# Create initiative
mkdir Initiatives/my-feature
cd Initiatives/my-feature

# Copy template
cp ../../.claude/reference/initiative-auto-update.md CLAUDE.md

# Edit the template with your context
```

### How Shannon Uses Initiative Context

When you work in an initiative folder, Shannon:

**1. Reads context on every request**
```
You: "Draft a PRD for the sharing feature"

Shannon (internally):
- Reads Initiatives/collaboration-features/CLAUDE.md
- Sees objective: "Enable async feedback on reports"
- Sees past decision: "Real-time collaboration deferred to Phase 2"
- Sees open question: "Do shared reports count against seat limits?"

Shannon: "I see we decided on async-only for Phase 1. Should this 
PRD address the open question about seat limits, or note it as TBD?"
```

**2. Tracks decisions automatically**
```
You: "Let's use view-only permissions as default"

Shannon: 
- Creates the PRD
- Updates CLAUDE.md with:
  **[Date]: Default Sharing Permissions**
  Decision: View-only default, users can grant edit access
  Rationale: 80% of shares are for stakeholder review, not editing
  Trade-off: Power users need extra click for edit access
```

**3. Maintains document history**
```
After creating PRD, Shannon updates CLAUDE.md:

**Documents Created:**
- [2026-01-26]: prd.md - Async sharing & feedback PRD
- [2026-01-24]: positioning.md - Product positioning (April Dunford)
- [2026-01-20]: research/user-interviews.md - 12 interviews analyzed
```

**4. Flags blockers and questions**
```
You: "We can't finalize pricing until we talk to Finance"

Shannon adds to CLAUDE.md:

**Current Blockers:**
- Pricing model decision (blocks enterprise sales pitch)
  Owner: You + Sarah (CEO)
  Deadline: Before Feb 1 board meeting
```

### The Power of Initiative Context

**Without initiative CLAUDE.md:**
```
You (3 weeks later): "Why did we decide on async instead of real-time?"
Generic AI: "I don't have that context. Can you remind me?"
```

**With initiative CLAUDE.md:**
```
You (3 weeks later): "Why did we decide on async instead of real-time?"

Shannon: "From Initiatives/collaboration-features/CLAUDE.md:

**[2026-01-20]: Real-time vs Async Collaboration**
Decision: Async-only for Phase 1
Rationale: User research showed 'get VP feedback' (async) not 
'edit together in real-time.' Real-time is 3x engineering cost.
Trade-off: Deferred real-time to Phase 2. Can revisit if 
enterprise customers request (currently 0 requests).

Want me to reconsider this decision based on new data?"
```

### Working Across Multiple Initiatives

Shannon keeps contexts separate:

```
# Working in Initiative A
cd Initiatives/collaboration-features
"Create a PRD" → Uses collaboration-features/CLAUDE.md context

# Switch to Initiative B  
cd ../enterprise-onboarding
"Create a PRD" → Uses enterprise-onboarding/CLAUDE.md context

# No context bleeding
Each initiative maintains its own decisions, timeline, constraints
```

### Initiative Best Practices

**Do:**
- ✅ Create one initiative per major project/feature
- ✅ Let Shannon maintain CLAUDE.md (it auto-updates)
- ✅ Reference past decisions: "Based on our Phase 1 decision..."
- ✅ Store all related docs in the initiative folder
- ✅ Review CLAUDE.md before status meetings (instant context refresh)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Manually edit CLAUDE.md often (Shannon maintains it)
- ❌ Create initiatives for small tasks (use for multi-week projects)
- ❌ Store unrelated work in initiative folders
- ❌ Duplicate decisions across multiple initiatives

### Real Example: Initiative in Action

```
Day 1: Create initiative
mkdir Initiatives/q1-collaboration
Shannon creates CLAUDE.md with objective, timeline, metrics

Day 3: Do user research
"Analyze these 12 interview transcripts"
Shannon updates CLAUDE.md with key insights, adds research doc

Day 7: Create PRD
"Create a Working Backwards PRD"
Shannon uses interview insights, updates CLAUDE.md with PRD link

Day 10: Positioning work
"Use April Dunford's framework to position this"
Shannon applies framework, records positioning decisions

Day 15: Pitch to leadership
"Create a Shape Up pitch for the betting table"
Shannon references all past work, creates pitch, updates status

Day 30: Status check
"Where are we on Q1 collaboration?"
Shannon reads CLAUDE.md: "Phase 1 complete. 3 blockers remain 
before Phase 2. Open question about pricing model needs Finance 
input by Feb 1."
```

### Initiative Context = Persistent Memory

Think of each initiative's `CLAUDE.md` as:
- **Project historian** - Remembers every decision and why
- **Context engine** - Instantly recalls past work
- **Decision log** - Tracks rationale to prevent rehashing  
- **Blocker tracker** - Surfaces what's stuck and who owns it
- **Document index** - Links all related artifacts

**You never lose context. You never rehash decisions. You never wonder "why did we decide that?"**

Shannon becomes the PM who was in every meeting, read every doc, and remembers everything.

See [Initiatives/README.md](Initiatives/README.md) for templates and detailed examples.

Five-step validation before every output:
- Does it answer "Why does this matter to customers?"
- Are trade-offs explicit?
- Are success metrics quantified?
- Can stakeholders take action?
- Would this pass executive scrutiny?

**3. Context That Persists**
Shannon remembers your role, product, team, decisions. No re-explaining frameworks or context every conversation.

**4. Credible by Association**
When you apply April Dunford's positioning or Ryan Singer's pitches, stakeholders recognize proven methodologies.
